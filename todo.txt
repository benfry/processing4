priorities/would like to fix soon (but not necessary for 4.0 final)
_ write a local.properties file when there's more than one file in the sketch
_   this will fix the majority of cases where sketch name is accidentally detached
_   for single .pde sketches, it's not a problem because it will find the file
_   but for multiple files, it needs to identify the main
_ pass through the source to update licenses
_   add Processing Foundation as 2012-15
_   update license info to state gplv2 not v3
_   run through that online license checker
_ add warnings to the old wiki pages with links to the newer versions
o change the license from GPL

_ completion mode pop-up not following dark and light mode conventions
_ Remove “Disable HiDPI Scaling” preference on Windows?
_   document it in the troubleshooting doc, ask people to report

organize this mess
_ implement support for Java “modules” and clean up JavaFX-specific workarounds
_   https://github.com/processing/processing4/issues/212
_   modules and classpath ugh https://stackoverflow.com/a/46289257
_ also the Crusty2D renderer for use with macOS hack stuff
_   actually need separate alpha/1.5/2.x versions of this
_ errors inside setup() aren't coming through at all?
_   seen in Eclipse; have to turn on the debugger... same as #4703?
_ mode list does not update after changing sketchbook folder
_   already reported?
_ make "Could not get the settings folder" message more helpful
_   https://github.com/processing/processing/issues/5744
_   need to check the locations it'd be writing to, and see if available
_   then tell the user which folder to fix
_   already fairly close, the problem is that they get a "report this" dialog box
_   but the useful information is in the actual exception message
_ import suggestions box needs design review
_   https://github.com/processing/processing/issues/3407
_ show compiling/startup animation after clicking run
_   or maybe show an animation for starting up
_   rather than post-compile
_   https://github.com/processing/processing/issues/136
_ save() and saveAs() need to be refactored
_   https://github.com/processing/processing/issues/3843
_ move Library to LibraryContribution and into contrib?
_ improve error message when creating a tab with the same name
_   right now it's generic, based on "a file exists"
_ don't allow users to create 'blah.java' when 'blah.pde' already in sketch
_ detect changes in case with libraries
_   https://github.com/processing/processing/issues/4507
_ modes are being loaded multiple times, which can cause trouble
_ jeditsyntax is a mess of old-style getModifiers()
_   would like to switch this over, but needs to be tested a lot

PDE - Processing Development Environment


PDE / Dialogs

_ option to suppress warning dialogs
_   starting with the one about modifying the sketch name for spaces
_   also the "some features will be disabled" with .java tabs
_   https://github.com/processing/processing/issues/46
_ add "don't warn me about this" for sketch renaming
_   make sure renamed version doesn't exist already
_ prompt user before nuking applet or application folders
_   along with a "don't ask me later"


PDE / Compiler & Preprocessor

medium (bugs/features)
_ preprocessor throws error when calling color() on a PGraphics
_   https://github.com/processing/processing/issues/3762
_ omitting a semicolon shows the error on the line after it
_ npe if library is removed before compile
_   always check library folders to make sure they're still valid
_ with additional .pde files, don't allow static mode in front tab
_   e.g. no setup()/draw() block
_ don't allow "for (blah; blah; blah) ;"
_   or if (blah blah blah) ;
_   it's never useful. students can use { } if they want an empty block

low (features)
_ copy running code from /tmp/buildXXxxx on crash of p5
_   should probably make a way to save/recover code
_   make the buildXxxx folders relate to time/date?
_ link out to further documentation (e.g. AIOOBE, NPE)

low (common errors around reserved names/class naming)
_ Saving sketch with the same name as a class or primitive breaks sketch
_   https://github.com/processing/processing/issues/196
_ don't allow people to override methods like paint()
_   make them final? just improve the error messages?
_   https://github.com/processing/processing/issues/1058
_ Processing chokes if a sketch defines a class with same name as the sketch
_   https://github.com/processing/processing/issues/196
_ don't allow goofy case versions of reserved words
_   keypressed should maybe throw an error
_   https://github.com/processing/processing/issues/44
_ "unexpected token" on anonymous instance of parameterized Comparator
_   https://github.com/processing/processing/issues/533


PDE / Editor

_ 'recent' menu paths can get enormous
_ active editor not being set null
_   in Base.nextEditorLocation(), changed to "editors.size() == 0"
_   instead of (activeEditor == null), but that's papering over a problem
_   where the active editor is not being set null
_ renaming RGB (.pde) to Rgb.java says "a file named RGB.pde already exists"
_ improve update check message "a new release (1.0.1) is available"
_   be more descriptive, use a second line in latest.txt
_   maybe just include the full text of the update message there?
_ go through other sketch-opening menus to check for disappearing sketches
_ deal with isManagingFocus() warning in the editor src
_ strange NullPointerException problem prevents launch
_   some kind of NPE in handleOpenInternal and friends
_   appears to be a synchronization problem with the loading
_ blank sketch opened even if another opened by double-click
_   add a 150 ms or more lag before opening the untitled window
_   https://github.com/processing/processing/issues/218
_ editors opening up at the same time on load?
_   either synchronize the open (at a minimum)
_   or wait for mac handlers to register an open event
_   can also cause problems with opening multiple copies of same sketch
_ after fixing name of sketch, ensure sketch of that name does not exist
_ add auto-save to the editor
_   https://github.com/processing/processing/issues/131
_ implement better method of showing curly brace closure
_   https://github.com/processing/processing/issues/94
_ setModified() getting called on Windows (probably Linux) for key cmds


PDE / Completion

_ text overlapping in the code completion popup
_   appears to be a bug in the text width calculations in JLabel
_ applyMatrix() sometimes ... and sometimes not
_   apparently "overloaded" methods are show as methodName(...) until selected
_   but the actual behavior seems inconsistent at best


PDE / Editor Toolbar (Buttons)

_ run button issues (unconfirmed)
_   does it unhighlight after compile or runtime errors?
_   also when using draw() instead of loop()
_     applet needs to notify runner that it has terminated
_   check 'finished' via objectreference?
_ EditorToolbar has two TODO items for open menu handling


PDE / Export

_ make possible to embed java for all platforms
_   straightforward to download from adoptium
_ export application ubuntu -> windows not working (2.2.1)
_   https://github.com/processing/processing/issues/2698
_   might be something with libraries (native or otherwise)
_ "error during export" message, but no error message contents come through
_   e.g. https://github.com/processing/processing/issues/4792


PDE / Libraries

_ alternate handling of duplicate library conflicts
_   https://github.com/processing/processing/pull/5126
_ Add a means to specify packages to import in library.properties
_   https://github.com/processing/processing/issues/2134


PDE / Examples

_ examples handling is less than ideal
_   examples not mentioned in warning dialog when installing
_   doesn't show in examples window for p5jsMode
_   the extra "Contributed Examples" subfolder is awkward
_   perhaps more important, examples need to specify their Mode
_     not ideal for Android since there's some crossover, but ok for Example sets
_     otherwise impossible to know how to populate the Examples window
_ several "Could not find a matching .properties file" with clocks pdex
_ examples window is per-Mode, but that doesn't seem helpful
_   just like sketchbook, you can open one from the other
_   or maybe just contribs show everywhere? hrm
_ make sure pdex/pdez files working, also on Windows
_   contrib examples are just too convoluted to double-click
_   folders inside folders, bleh
_   what Mode are they for?
_ pdez links for contribs, not just the .zip
_   fix the code so that the contribs manager will handle it
_   though that's bad for earlier contribs, hrm
_ document pdez and pdex files so that folks can use them
_ load examples from pdez files
_   250 example (folders), would cut ~8-900 files to just those 250
_   https://github.com/processing/processing/issues/182
_ examples window sketches should load in proper environment
_   test for what happens:
_   if Java Mode is in front, and user double-clicks another Mode's entry
_ write build.xml file to automatically update the examples
_ when adding a new library, its examples aren't added to the list until restart


PDE / Manager (4.x notes)

_ remove dorky loading.gif (used in ContributionTab and UpdateContributionTab)
_   should be a better way to implement this
_ if no internet available, install buttons disabled, but not clear why broken
_ also if update check disabled, user isn't notified that contribs unavailable
_ currently no indication that contrib download failed
_   so the 'try again' won't show up; everything looks fine
_   (was this for the contrib listing? or an actual contrib?)
_ ContributionTab.updateContributionListing()
_   this one shouldn't be in a single tab
_   and it should include all contribs (method from Base to get in one swoop?)
_   this is also likely the cause of per-Mode weirdness
_ Base.setUpdatesAvailable() is called from half a dozen places!?
_ how to handle contrib manager download/retry/etc and showing progress
_ ListPanel.configureStatusColumnLabel() getting null DetailPanel objects
_   seems to be out of sync/unavailable data based on more recent contrib changes?
_ ManagerFrame.downloadAndUpdateContributionListing()
_   should not even be run, because the contribs load on startup
_   but ContributionTab.tryAgainButton needs to be able to request re-download
_ ManagerFrame.makeAndShowTab()
_   this one looks like it's gonna get called multiple times
_ holy s*t ContributionTableModel is using all of the contribs
_ after failed update of Mode, the button is no longer available
_   have to click something else, then click back on the Mode line again
_ when starting in p5jsMode, contrib manager shows no green checks for libs
_   tricky because those aren't gonna show up in 'Add Library'
_   which is another case for a separate 'contrib manager' thing
_     maybe that's the update button? when no updates, it's still a button?
_ after opening Editor window, Processing freezes until contribs are loaded
_ when opening manager, animation runs briefly then freezes
_ DetailPanel setContribution() being called 4x for each contrib on startup
_ during install of contrib, progress is halting during the install
_   probably too much happening on the EDT that should not be
_ optimize ContributionTab addListener() call in constructor
X   no longer calling addListener() on every single entry, whcih helps
_   but what else might that change be breaking?
_ StatusPanel seems to be recreated entirely
_ StatusPanel being reset twice on each click
_   is checking for previous, but apparently that's not working
_ AvailableContribution.install() needs status handler
_   can either be the StatusPanel *or* EditorStatus *or* console (during startup)
_   needs to be EditorStatus when double-clicking a .pdex file
_   this is also why Base.handleOpen() does statusError() calls during pdex load
_ add indicator for the stats of libraries
_   https://download.processing.org/stats
_   add rank for libraries/modes/tools (use unicode chars?)
_   probably not sort by default to avoid confusion
_ lots of rewriting to use SwingWorker
_   https://docs.oracle.com/javase/tutorial/uiswing/concurrency/worker.html
_   obvious places where this needs to happen, but the code is working for now
_   needs a few hours work to untangle all of it, but worth the regressions?
_ get rid of IgnorableException
_ contrib/mode/lib/example List objects in Base
_   which of these should be Set objects?
_ JProgressBar in StatusPanel is shared by all installing contribs
_   which could make for weird behavior if installs before something has finished
_   work to prevent multiple from colliding
_   (i.e. get rid of ContribProgress class)
X disable hashCode() implementation in Contribution
X   was getting in the way of comparisons
_   but need to compare the entries differently so there aren't dupes
_   i.e. it was doing a name comparison, so need to swap by name
_ after library/tool changes, rebuild Help > Library/Tool Reference submenus
_ could not write to temporary directory (virus checker problems)
_   https://github.com/processing/processing/issues/4757


PDE / Manager (3.x notes)

_ Fix vertical placement of top elements in the Manager window
_   https://github.com/processing/processing4/issues/520
_   vertical centering of the search box in the manager
_ “could not move the contribution to the backup folder” message while updating
_   problem is that any sketch that uses a library, the lib is stuck as "in use"
_   https://github.com/processing/processing/issues/4973
_ issues with updating modes
_   https://github.com/processing/processing/issues/5424
_ examples window not updating on install
_   open examples window
_   mode > add mode > libraries > install video
_   did not update the examples window, had to restart pde
_ was able to save over the video capture examples b/c they were a library
_   lib examples not properly marked as read-only
_ "Could not find a examples in the downloaded file" is a poorly worded message
_ 'version' should be x.y or x.y.z, not some extra long string
_   enforce this by disallowing spaces? on the import script?
_ Progress bar height on macOS is too thin
_   https://github.com/processing/processing/issues/4734
_ proper error handling when downloading contribs listing
_   https://github.com/processing/processing/issues/4732
_ update CM entries when sketchbook location changes
_   https://github.com/processing/processing/issues/3927
_ ugly white gap at the top of scroll bar
_   the table header doesn't extend far enough
_ scrolling "past" top/bottom causes the screen to jiggle (OS X and Trackpad)
_   looks like ContributionListing.getScrollableUnitIncrement() returns early
_ Examples window closes and re-opens during library install/remove
_   https://github.com/processing/processing/issues/3304
_ several TODO items listed in ContributionPanel
_ something to set min/max versions that are supported by a library
_ ability to cancel a download/install
_ we shouldn't use .properties extension for modes, et al
_   because a .properties file is iso8859-1
_ make note that .properties file *must* be utf-8
_   if not it'll make things gross (andre sier flob library)
_ why wasn't Library moved to LibraryContribution?
_   or that LibraryContribution needs to be a wrapper around it?
_ send info on 'check for updates' so we know about libs/modes/etc?
_   how to disclose to users?
_   only send for items that are part of the public list
_     otherwise we're sending private libraries/installs
_     although this won't pick up old libraries not on the new system
_ classpath conflicts..
_   getPackageList.. from Library... maybe others?
_   really need to make sure that a weird core.jar isn't being imported
_   coffeescript was doing this and breaking the pde
_ contrib library examples are not read-only
_   another point for doing .zip files to prevent overwriting
_ add BookContribution?
_ will offer to open the contrib manager even though it's already open
_   though this was looking at libraries, and there may have been modes
_   is there an "all" view for the mgr that shows libs, modes, etc?
_ update button only showing up when item is selected feels awkward
_ "update all" would be useful
_   "Update 4 items" as a button name
_ new libraries not picked up when changing sketchbook location
_ make sure contrib manager can run w/o a network connection
_   or if a bad document comes through, it can recover
_ alternating blue/white backgrounds aren't updated after changing filter
_   just need to call a repaint() after a filter change?
_ check with Casey about coloring for error messages
_ test on Windows and Linux
_ font size for "Downloading" on progress bar is too large
_   but changing the size breaks the vertical centering
_ wheel mouse is super jumpy
_   something about unit increment in ContributionListPanel
_ arrow keys up/down move scroll bar, not selection
_ fonts/etc need to be set in one place where they can be edited
_   move styling to separate constants that are more accessible


PDE / Preferences

_ need to do the Mode prefs separately
_   since we can't have per-Mode constants (the pref names) in PreferencesFrame
_ Editor.applyFrame() may not have a valid 'editor' object to work with
_   if windows closed, and prefs altered, NPE thrown
_   make sure editor isn't trying to apply prefs when no editor is open
_   (on mac os x, due to the change for no windows open)
_ clear up prefs so that multiple editors don't trash each other's prefs
_   when are prefs saved? could instead save whenever changes are made
_   and then if the file gets modified, it'll put up an error message
_   also, this may be part of why other sketches aren't reloading properly
_ simple prefs implementation to set key/value pairs using a JTable
_   https://github.com/processing/processing/issues/5425
_ prefs window doesn't swap ok/cancel properly for mac vs. windows/linux
_   don't bother having a "cancel" for the prefs window
_ make prefs dialog modal?


PDE / Runner

_ if RuntimeException thrown, needs to check if it's a wrapped exception
_   for instance, if there's a crash inside makeGraphics()
_   this inside the handling that comes from the JVM, which makes it tricky
_ draw mode apps do not shut off the run button when finished
_   need to talk to VM and read when 'finished' var is set
_ does closing the window call stop()?
_   need to make sure hitting stop button and closing window explicitly call
_   set finished to true, then join() the animation thread
_ dispose handlers not called when stop button pressed
_   https://github.com/processing/processing/issues/4445
_ need to set dock icon title on osx
_ changing number of screens between run causes things to show up off-screen
_   so when running, check to make sure that things are out of the area


PDE / Debug

_ mouse events (i.e. toggle breakpoint) seem to be firing twice
_   wonder if this is mousePressed and mouseClicked?
_   this may also be the cause of the double entries in files
_ fix background color for selected lines in VariableInspector
_   https://github.com/processing/processing/issues/3925
_ deactivate step, continue, stop when not running?
_ disable the debug toggle menu while running
_   otherwise could run in one mode, then try to stop in another


PDE / Multiple Monitors

_ changing modes brings the PDE back on the second screen
_   the Find window (also the save windows) also have the same problem


PDE / Tweak

_ TweakMode listener mess in JavaTextArea
_   https://github.com/processing/processing/issues/4605


PDE / Sketch & Sketchbook

_ Saving sketch with the same name as a class
_   https://github.com/processing/processing/pull/4033
_ fix up the code for sketchbook building
_   is it time to make the internal representation into a tree object
_   and then build the GUI versions separately (on the EDT)
_ Base.checkSketchFolder() is used to identify sketches for the sketchbook frame
_   but it assumes that it's folder name + default extension as the name for it
_   that should be moved into the Mode class as a "is this folder a sketch" call
_   (so that Modes can work differently too)
_ Mode.rebuildLibraryList() called too many times on startup?
_   and when sketches saved as well?
_   makes saving *really* slow with a lot of libraries
_ New/Rename/Save As is reloading the whole sketchbook, argh
_ improve start time by populating sketchbook/libraries on threads
_   https://github.com/processing/processing/issues/2945
_ Large number of files in sketchbook folder can cause slow startup
_   and/or errors with launch4j
_   https://github.com/processing/processing/issues/1190
_ error that sketch is read-only can't be canceled
_   hitting cancel (or ESC?) still brings up the save dialog
_ ArticulatePrint-070103a.pde from ArticulatePrint-070103a loads ok
_   but when opening the sketch, it leaves out the file
_   because there's a dash in the name
_   and instead only loads StemCell.pde
_ show progress dialog during export and save
_ hitting ESC on "create this, move file, continue" opened anyway


PDE / Commander

_ command line complaints
_   https://github.com/processing/processing/issues/6129
_ emacs style errors in commander aren't quite right
_   https://github.com/processing/processing/issues/2158
_ better command line support/basic language server support?
_   make it easier to use with other editors

TOOLS / Movie Maker

_ downloader for ffmpeg instead of including in download
_   would save ~20-25 MB in the download
_   should prompt the user before starting the download (not nice to use bandwidth)
_   need to disable creation of movies until the download has finished
_   handle failed downloads as well
_   make sure there are no signing problems on macOS after downloading


TOOLS / Ideas

_ eclipse import/export
_   simple mechanism to export to eclipse
_     don't worry about subversion stuff, just export with libraries
_   something clever to import back from eclipse
_   could keep the .svn files in with the libs and all
_   then when exporting for eclipse, people can update as necessary
_   -> dan et al say better to do fixed versions and have it work simply
_ import sketch from url (takes a zip from archive sketch)
_ archive sketch direct to bug report
_ shared code
_   Integrator / FloatThing / CameraStuff -- Update
_   to pull code from a local folder
_   update will update classes from shared in the current folder


TOOLS / Auto Format

_ Reas: comments go nasty when auto-formatted
_ Switch block cases not indented
_   https://github.com/processing/processing/issues/1042
_ do a better job of maintaining cursor
_ only auto-format a particular section of code
_   set the 'tabs' var based on how many spaces on previous line
_   http://processing.org/discourse/yabb/YaBB.cgi?board=Proce55ing_Software;action=display;num=1087227217


LIBRARIES / General

_ need to unpack InvocationTargetException in xxxxxxEvent calls
_   http://processing.org/discourse/yabb_beta/YaBB.cgi?board=VideoCamera;action=display;num=1116850328#3
_ go through libraries and clean things up
protected void finalize() throws Throwable {
  try {
    close();
  } catch (Exception e) {
    // do something
  } finally {
    super.finalize();
    // more code can be written here as per need of application
  }
}


LIBRARIES / Net

_ modernize Client/Server code to use synchronized lists
_   do we let people use the public vars in Server and Client?
_   are they documented?


MODES / Python 2

X add JavaFX handler
X opening an example throws an NPE
_ update Export to Application to use the new window
_ add changes for the eawt mess? (too tricky)
_   https://github.com/jdf/processing.py/issues/398
_ submit a PR

DIST

How the environment gets packed up, downloaded, and installed.


DIST / General

_ when lib downloads (batik) go dead, fallback to download.processing.org
_   or for now, tell users how to do it manually
_   batik and ant have both broken the build when old versions were removed
_ move processing-java inside the Java Mode?
_   make a Tool that installs it for all platforms, not just OS X
_   not really part of the 'build' anymore
_ line ending issues
_   doesn't really help on Windows since we use Cygwin
_     but it would be helpful for people not using it (ant/other LF issues)
_   https://help.github.com/articles/dealing-with-line-endings
_   http://stackoverflow.com/questions/170961/whats-the-best-crlf-handling-strategy-with-git
_ add means to move changes from desktop to Android (and vice-versa)
_ add bootclasspath for 1.6
_   would require --install for command line on OS X
_   and unpacking the JVM earlier in the build process
_   not sure if it's worth the addl complexity
_ add additional caveats about incompletion to javadoc
_ drag and drop
_   including the number of items added to sketch would be especially nice
_ implement automatic update
_   https://github.com/processing/processing/issues/100
_ need .pde document icons
_ need .psk file icon
_ need exported application icons
_ need more comprehensive list of 'known bugs'
_ need more comprehensive list of 'known suggestions'
_ write notes about running p5 on another platforms

DOC / Misc

_ thread safety with color() et al
_   https://github.com/processing/processing4/issues/431#issuecomment-1057979636
_ thread safety for drawing functions in general
_ words on how key/mouse events are queued to the end of draw so they're safe
_ make reference build process part of dist
_   https://github.com/processing/processing-docs/issues/85
_   separate ant target, but only require them for dist
_   as separate targets, folks can build explicitly if they'd like
_   processing-docs/java_generate/ReferenceGenerator/processingrefBuild.sh
_ find in reference for copy() (on image) tries to open PVector.copy()
_   might need disambiguation pages?
_   if a reference page is missing, throws a bunch of exceptions
_   i.e. PVector.copy() not in the reference
_ yahoo search example is out of date (included in the examples? the book?)
_ stop() to shut down a sketch (but not quit/close window)
_   actually pause/resume
_ MIN_FLOAT, MAX_FLOAT, also the difference from the Java functions
_   also MIN_INT and MAX_INT, even though those are more similar
_ update the reference to cover parseXxxx() stuff
_   also add notes about parseInt/Float(blah, otherwise)
_ also parseInt and parseFloat, how they can return another number or NaN
_   should the default be NaN or 0?
_ get/set are faster way draw screen space images, but no tint, no translations
_ make sure the docs include "beginShape() cannot be nested"
_   also add error messages to the renderers
_   also note that ellipse() et al use beginShape()
_   and that java2d should complain if people try it
_ method to go from function name to the included examples where used?
_ encourage use of set() instead of point() in the drawing api
_   https://forum.processing.org/beta/num_1114204116.html
_ noLoop() isn't the same as "finished", though it's sometimes used that way
_   to finish, use exit() (though that will make the window close)
_   add this to ref once halt() is finished
_ errors in pdf/index.html examples
_   probably remove these, move the useful ones to the examples folder
_   that way people will read the reference
_ explanation of how we see libraries in the PDE
_   We're making an assumption that the idea of a "library" refers to a block of Java-based code. The reasoning is that from within the PDE, we anticipate that it will be Java-compatible versions of other languages (such as Jython, JRuby, or Scala) as opposed to more generic languages. In the future we could open this up, but we'd rather not complicate things for the moment.

DOC / Text

_ how to use textMode(SHAPE) with opengl
_   things will be extremely slow (fix later)
_   things will also be very ugly on-screen
_ text being nicer in java2d
_   use createFont() to load the font or use a font from your machine
_   note that createFont() is no good for applets/export to web
_ textMode(SCREEN) for P2D and P3D for nice fast text in screen space
_   currently slow in JAVA2D and OPENGL, but this will improve
_ what is the vlw font file format?
_ shapes from 3D type
_   the way to do it (will improve later) is to use some undocumented features
_   1) you have to use the OPENGL renderer
_   2) use textMode(SHAPE);
_   3) use createFont() (which you already are)
_   this will convert all the shape data from the fonts for writing.
_   it will be *extremely* slow, which is part of why it's not documented yet.
_   but it will work with beginRaw().
_ improve documentation of the pdf stuff
_   be clearer about the font setup stuff
_   fonts by default not working that well?
