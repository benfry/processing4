_ interface zoom now conflicting with the Java 9+ defaults
_   things look terrible (tiny fonts) on Windows, adjusting has weird effects
_   resolve in DefaultPlatform and Toolkit, disable ui in PreferencesFrame


. . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . .


_ remove selectMode() code from Base... just too funky
_   should just go back to the default Mode, or the first that matches
_   not enough Modes to warrant all the weirdness that could happen
_   and for Android (the only legit case), local.properties should be set
_   or we have changeMode() to make it an easy switch

_ errors when files removed during "git checkout <branch>"
_   the tab has already disappeared, so complains it can't find the SketchCode

_ replace bug numbers
_   http://dev.processing.org/bugs/show_bug.cgi?id=1188
_   with http://processing.org/bugs/bugzilla/1188.html
_   also code.google.com URLs with Github URLs (numbers are sorta in sync)

_ when lib downloads (batik) go dead, fallback to download.processing.org
_   or for now, tell users how to do it manually
_   batik and ant have both broken the build when old versions were removed


contribs
_ ListPanel.configureStatusColumnLabel() getting null DetailPanel objects
_   seems to be out of sync/unavailable data based on more recent contrib changes?
_ several "Could not find a matching .properties file" with clocks pdex
_ examples window is per-Mode, but that doesn't seem helpful
_   just like sketchbook, you can open one from the other
_   or maybe just contribs show everywhere? hrm
_ make sure pdex/pdez files working, also on Windows
_   contrib examples are just too convoluted to double-click
_   folders inside folders, bleh
_   what Mode are they for?
_ pdez links for contribs, not just the .zip
_   fix the code so that the contribs manager will handle it
_   though that's bad for earlier contribs, hrm
_ document pdez and pdex files so that folks can use them
_ load examples from pdez files
_   250 example (folders), would cut ~8-900 files to just those 250
_   https://github.com/processing/processing/issues/182
_ examples window sketches should load in proper environment
_   test for what happens:
_   if Java Mode is in front, and user double-clicks another Mode's entry
_ write build.xml file to automatically update the examples
_ when adding a new library, its examples aren't added to the list until restart


manager
_ after opening Editor window, Processing freezes until contribs are loaded
_ when opening manager, animation runs briefly then freezes
_ DetailPanel setContribution() being called 4x for each contrib on startup
_ during install of contrib, progress is halting during the install
_   probably too much happening on the EDT that should not be
_ optimize ContributionTab addListener() call in constructor
X   no longer calling addListener() on every single entry, whcih helps
_   but what else might that change be breaking?
_ StatusPanel seems to be recreated entirely
_ StatusPanel being reset twice on each click
_   is checking for previous, but apparently that's not working
_ Base.setUpdatesAvailable() is called from half a dozen places!?
_ AvailableContribution.install() needs status handler
_   can either be the StatusPanel *or* EditorStatus *or* console (during startup)
_   needs to be EditorStatus when double-clicking a .pdex file
_   this is also why Base.handleOpen() does statusError() calls during pdex load, bleh


design
_ console scroll bar colors
_ errors table theme
_ contrib manager theme
_   implement updateTheme()
_   identify coloring for icons
_   how much of theme to inherit
_   generate manager icons
_ implement document icons on Windows
_ implement document icons on Linux
_ decision about 'debug' versions of toolbar icons
_ add notes about params to the wiki
_ Update graphics and visual design elements for 4.x
_   https://github.com/processing/processing4/issues/48
_ welcome screen is a mess
_ also lib/icons has the pde icon set and the foundation icon (for contribs)
_ sort out ui.font plus the other fonts inside theme.txt
_   Toolkit.getSansFont() will use the internal ProcessingSansPro font
_     which means it gets used inside ManagerFrame,
_     and prevents the theme from updating the font
_   while that font could exist in theme.txt,
_     getSansFont() also handles the language fallback version
_     which perhaps, that pref should come from the translations: i.e. an override setting
_   decision: set the default sans, bold, and mono font in language file
_     can be overridden in preferences.txt
_     specify ui.sans.plain, ui.sans.bold, ui.sans.mono in theme.txt
_     need a separate identifier for the builtin sans (now called processing.sans)
_     and when theme wants to ask for a sans font
_ better default fonts for Swing; argh

platforms
_ https://github.com/processing/processing4/wiki/Supported-Platforms
_ update JavaFX to use the supported platforms
_ update Video library to use the new layout


decisions before final 4.0 release
_ can we compress jdk/Contents/Home/legal into a single zip?
_ should we use Java 11 instead of 17 to be less of an outlier?
_   default rpi openjdk seems to be 11, we're not using any 17 features
_   size change is negligible (17 may even be slightly smaller)
_   or is this just a matter of 17 being new and it'll change quickly?
_   JavaFX 17 (a good idea) seems to be compatible with Java 11
_     JavaFX 11 has fewer builds (no ARM, prolly no Apple Silicon)
_   11 LTS is supported until September 2026, 17 until 2029
_   https://dzone.com/articles/whats-new-between-java-11-and-java-17
_ Friendly Names for new Sketches (includes UI for switching it back)
_   https://github.com/processing/processing/pull/6048
_ change the license from GPL
_   then pass through the source to update licenses
_   add Processing Foundation as 2012-15
_   update license info to state gplv2 not v3
_   run through that online license checker
_ add a Tool for removing extended attributes? xattr -cr /path/to/Something.app
_ when exporting an app, run xattr on it to handle "app is damaged" errors?
_   xattr -cr /path/to/application.app
_   -c removes attributes, -r is recursive
_   https://github.com/processing/processing/issues/4214
_ make the call on the launcher setting for Linux
_   https://github.com/processing/processing4/issues/247
_ show warnings about wrong library folder layout?
_ Welcome screen or not?
_   set a new preference for it, so people see it
_   just skip the welcome screen on Windows hidpi dipslays?
_   better to launch a web browser
_     also use id/ask for login to help understand community?
_   tell users about JavaFX, Movie Maker install, changing themes
_ Remove “Disable HiDPI Scaling” preference on Windows?
_ break Movie Maker out to its own library?
_   another big leap in file size reduction for the PDE download
_   but need to figure out a good way to highlight it/encourage installation
_   ...as well as the other libraries? separate window?
_ auto-complete not triggering, workaround as pref?
_   Auto-completion: [ ] Disabled  [ ] Show on Ctrl-Space  [ ] Always show
_   https://github.com/processing/processing/issues/5691

_ detach sketch name and folder name (use sketch.properties)
_   better for git, etc
_   single file thing is long gone
_   introduce the idea of 'scraps' (ala gist) that are just single page blobs
_ what to double-click when opening p5 projects (.pdp?)
_   lack of a project file makes this a little bit of a headache
_   dropping a sketch folder onto the PDE should also be implemented
_ startup is so incredibly slow
X   the splash screen comes up fairly quickly, so what gives?
_   lots of EDT thread stuff, particularly with loading contribs
_   handleNew() taking 2-3s?

all i can do is find things that might trigger them, but it's more likely
than not to be a java problem, and not something that can be fixed
_ explanation of how we see libraries in the PDE
_   We're making an assumption that the idea of a "library" refers to a block of Java-based code. The reasoning is that from within the PDE, we anticipate that it will be Java-compatible versions of other languages (such as Jython, JRuby, or Scala) as opposed to more generic languages. In the future we could open this up, but we'd rather not complicate things for the moment.

DOC / Text

_ how to use textMode(SHAPE) with opengl
_   things will be extremely slow (fix later)
_   things will also be very ugly on-screen
_ text being nicer in java2d
_   use createFont() to load the font or use a font from your machine
_   note that createFont() is no good for applets/export to web
_ textMode(SCREEN) for P2D and P3D for nice fast text in screen space
_   currently slow in JAVA2D and OPENGL, but this will improve
_ what is the vlw font file format?
_ shapes from 3D type
_   the way to do it (will improve later) is to use some undocumented features
_   1) you have to use the OPENGL renderer
_   2) use textMode(SHAPE);
_   3) use createFont() (which you already are)
_   this will convert all the shape data from the fonts for writing.
_   it will be *extremely* slow, which is part of why it's not documented yet.
_   but it will work with beginRaw().
_ improve documentation of the pdf stuff
_   be clearer about the font setup stuff
_   fonts by default not working that well?

PDE - Processing Development Environment


PDE / Dialogs

_ two-tiered dialogs for everything - use big font/little font style throughout
_   http://javagraphics.blogspot.com/2008/06/joptionpane-making-alternative.html
_ option to suppress warning dialogs
_   starting with the one about modifying the sketch name for spaces
_   also the "some features will be disabled" with .java tabs
_   https://github.com/processing/processing/issues/46
_ add "don't warn me about this" for sketch renaming
_   make sure renamed version doesn't exist already
_ prompt user before nuking applet or application folders
_   along with a "don't ask me later"
_ use macosx dialogs for all of the editor stuff
_   see about doing the same on windows, linux?
_   the others seem to respond ok to the lucida grande since they use defaults
_ vista style dialogs
_   http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/bb328626.aspx
_ confirmation dialogs (save and don't save.. who'd a thunk it)
_   http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/aa511273.aspx
_   http://i.msdn.microsoft.com/Aa511273.Confirmations03(en-us,MSDN.10).png


PDE / Compiler & Preprocessor

medium (bugs/features)
_ preprocessor throws error when calling color() on a PGraphics
_   https://github.com/processing/processing/issues/3762
_ omitting a semicolon shows the error on the line after it
_ npe if library is removed before compile
_   always check library folders to make sure they're still valid
_ with additional .pde files, don't allow static mode in front tab
_   e.g. no setup()/draw() block
_ don't allow "for (blah; blah; blah) ;"
_   or if (blah blah blah) ;
_   it's never useful. students can use { } if they want an empty block

low (features)
_ copy running code from /tmp/buildXXxxx on crash of p5
_   should probably make a way to save/recover code
_   make the buildXxxx folders relate to time/date?
_ link out to further documentation (e.g. AIOOBE, NPE)

low (common errors around reserved names/class naming)
_ Saving sketch with the same name as a class or primitive breaks sketch
_   https://github.com/processing/processing/issues/196
_ don't allow people to override methods like paint()
_   make them final? just improve the error messages?
_   https://github.com/processing/processing/issues/1058
_ Processing chokes if a sketch defines a class with same name as the sketch
_   https://github.com/processing/processing/issues/196
_ don't allow goofy case versions of reserved words
_   keypressed should maybe throw an error
_   https://github.com/processing/processing/issues/44
_ "unexpected token" on anonymous instance of parameterized Comparator
_   https://github.com/processing/processing/issues/533


PDE / Editor

_ 'recent' menu doesn't respect examples folder of other p5 versions
_   could write that into the file, that it's an example
_   or write the path as shown in the PDE to the file as simpler
_ 'recent' menu paths can get enormous
_ active editor not being set null
_   in Base.nextEditorLocation(), changed to "editors.size() == 0"
_   instead of (activeEditor == null), but that's papering over a problem
_   where the active editor is not being set null
_ renaming RGB (.pde) to Rgb.java says "a file named RGB.pde already exists"
_ improve update check message "a new release (1.0.1) is available"
_   be more descriptive, use a second line in latest.txt
_   maybe just include the full text of the update message there?
_ go through other sketch-opening menus to check for disappearing sketches
_ deal with isManagingFocus() warning in the editor src
_ strange NullPointerException problem prevents launch
_   some kind of NPE in handleOpenInternal and friends
_   appears to be a synchronization problem with the loading
_ blank sketch opened even if another opened by double-click
_   add a 150 ms or more lag before opening the untitled window
_   https://github.com/processing/processing/issues/218
_ editors opening up at the same time on load?
_   either synchronize the open (at a minimum)
_   or wait for mac handlers to register an open event
_   can also cause problems with opening multiple copies of same sketch
_ after fixing name of sketch, ensure sketch of that name does not exist
_ add auto-save to the editor
_   https://github.com/processing/processing/issues/131
_ implement better method of showing curly brace closure
_   https://github.com/processing/processing/issues/94
_ setModified() getting called on Windows (probably Linux) for key cmds


PDE / Editor Toolbar (Buttons)

_ run button issues (unconfirmed)
_   does it unhighlight after compile or runtime errors?
_   also when using draw() instead of loop()
_     applet needs to notify runner that it has terminated
_   check 'finished' via objectreference?
_ EditorToolbar has two TODO items for open menu handling


PDE / Export

_ export application ubuntu -> windows not working (2.2.1)
_   https://github.com/processing/processing/issues/2698
_   might be something with libraries (native or otherwise)
_ "error during export" message, but no error message contents come through
_   e.g. https://github.com/processing/processing/issues/4792
_ if the lib folder goes missing from export, give an error
_   also any .jar files that are missing, give an error
_   showing more debug messages (command line?)
_ when exporting to application (or applet) don't copy .java files from folder
_   (they'll be copied as source files later)
_   make .java files and friends go to correct locations on export (app)
_ warn on export when people call their sketches things like Server
_ warn if someone extends PApplet but mis-names the sketch
_   or don't allow it to be exported
_   add bug reference to the faq once added to the db
X   or at least add a note about this to the faq
_ show error when no main() is included but class extends PApplet
_   error can happen or be checked
_ exporting application copies .java files
_   .java files are copied to the root folder as well as the source folder


PDE / Libraries

_ alternate handling of duplicate library conflicts
_   https://github.com/processing/processing/pull/5126
_ Add a means to specify packages to import in library.properties
_   https://github.com/processing/processing/issues/2134
_ need to deal with classpath conflicts
_   avoid garbage that people have installed on their machines
_   antlr.jar in the classpath will cause trouble..
_     http://processing.org/discourse/yabb_beta/YaBB.cgi?board=SoftwareBugs;action=display;num=1138652326
_   jogl jar files, or jogl install will cause trouble
_     /System/Library/Java/Extensions or /Library/Java/Extensions
_     the /System one contains qtjava
_     the /Library one is empty (by default), maybe skip it?
_ classpath conflicts also problem with PDE itself
_   catch antlr conflicts, and put up an error message
_   http://dev.processing.org/bugs/show_bug.cgi?id=1225 (no Google issue)
_ make sure there aren't library jar files named the same thing
_   i.e. if one library has db.jar, then that's gonna kill another db.jar
_   when the files are copied over
_ java.ext.dirs for /System/Library/Java/Extensions
_   http://java.sun.com/j2se/1.5.0/docs/guide/extensions/spec.html
_   can set java.ext.dirs to something else
_   on osx, just ignore anything in /Library/Java/Extensions (but not others)?
_ native lib stuff, use native.txt in lib folder, then:
_   String osName = System.getProperty("os.name");
_   String osArch = System.getProperty("os.arch");
_   http://stackoverflow.com/questions/1611357/how-to-make-a-jar-file-that-include-dll-files
_ need better error messages for broken api / library troubles
_   e.g. ocd is broken in 0125 because of method signature changes


PDE / Manager

_ Manager fails to complete install of PythonMode when no windows open
_   https://github.com/processing/processing/issues/5309
_ Python Mode not downloading?
_   https://github.com/processing/processing/issues/5918
_ an incompatible Mode prevents the PDE from quitting after last window is closed
_   https://github.com/processing/processing/issues/5112
_ “could not move the contribution to the backup folder” message while updating
_   problem is that any sketch that uses a library, the lib is stuck as "in use"
_   https://github.com/processing/processing/issues/4973
_ issues with updating modes
_   https://github.com/processing/processing/issues/5424
_ examples window not updating on install
_   open examples window
_   mode > add mode > libraries > install video
_   did not update the examples window, had to restart pde
_ was able to save over the video capture examples b/c they were a library
_   lib examples not properly marked as read-only
_ "Could not find a examples in the downloaded file" is a poorly worded message
_ 'version' should be x.y or x.y.z, not some extra long string
_   enforce this by disallowing spaces? on the import script?
_ Progress bar height on macOS is too thin
_   https://github.com/processing/processing/issues/4734
_ proper error handling when downloading contribs listing
_   https://github.com/processing/processing/issues/4732
_ update CM entries when sketchbook location changes
_   https://github.com/processing/processing/issues/3927
_ ugly white gap at the top of scroll bar
_   the table header doesn't extend far enough
_ scrolling "past" top/bottom causes the screen to jiggle (OS X and Trackpad)
_   looks like ContributionListing.getScrollableUnitIncrement() returns early
_ Examples window closes and re-opens during library install/remove
_   https://github.com/processing/processing/issues/3304
_ CM - Icon instead of an "X" for the "could not connect" message
_   https://github.com/processing/processing/issues/3706
_ several TODO items listed in ContributionPanel
_ something to set min/max versions that are supported by a library
_ ability to cancel a download/install
_ we shouldn't use .properties extension for modes, et al
_   because a .properties file is iso8859-1
_ make note that .properties file *must* be utf-8
_   if not it'll make things gross (andre sier flob library)
_ why wasn't Library moved to LibraryContribution?
_   or that LibraryContribution needs to be a wrapper around it?
_ send info on 'check for updates' so we know about libs/modes/etc?
_   how to disclose to users?
_   only send for items that are part of the public list
_     otherwise we're sending private libraries/installs
_     although this won't pick up old libraries not on the new system
_ classpath conflicts..
_   getPackageList.. from Library... maybe others?
_   really need to make sure that a weird core.jar isn't being imported
_   coffeescript was doing this and breaking the pde
_ contrib library examples are not read-only
_   another point for doing .zip files to prevent overwriting
_ add BookContribution?
_ will offer to open the contrib manager even though it's already open
_   though this was looking at libraries, and there may have been modes
_   is there an "all" view for the mgr that shows libs, modes, etc?
_ update button only showing up when item is selected feels awkward
_ "update all" would be useful
_   "Update 4 items" as a button name
_ new libraries not picked up when changing sketchbook location
_ make sure contrib manager can run w/o a network connection
_   or if a bad document comes through, it can recover
_ alternating blue/white backgrounds aren't updated after changing filter
_   just need to call a repaint() after a filter change?
_ check with Casey about coloring for error messages
_ test on Windows and Linux
_ font size for "Downloading" on progress bar is too large
_   but changing the size breaks the vertical centering
_ highlight color seems to be incorrect?
_ after installing, the item in the manager list doesn't change color
_ wheel mouse is super jumpy
_   something about unit increment in ContributionListPanel
_ arrow keys up/down move scroll bar, not selection
_ fonts/etc need to be set in one place where they can be edited
_   move styling to separate constants that are more accessible


PDE / Preferences

_ Editor.applyFrame() may not have a valid 'editor' object to work with
_   if windows closed, and prefs altered, NPE thrown
_   make sure editor isn't trying to apply prefs when no editor is open
_   (on mac os x, due to the change for no windows open)
_ clear up prefs so that multiple editors don't trash each other's prefs
_   when are prefs saved? could instead save whenever changes are made
_   and then if the file gets modified, it'll put up an error message
_   also, this may be part of why other sketches aren't reloading properly
_ simple prefs implementation to set key/value pairs using a JTable
_   https://github.com/processing/processing/issues/5425
_ prefs window doesn't swap ok/cancel properly for mac vs. windows/linux
_   don't bother having a "cancel" for the prefs window
_ make prefs dialog modal?


PDE / Runner

_ if RuntimeException thrown, needs to check if it's a wrapped exception
_   for instance, if there's a crash inside makeGraphics()
_   this inside the handling that comes from the JVM, which makes it tricky
_ draw mode apps do not shut off the run button when finished
_   need to talk to VM and read when 'finished' var is set
_ does closing the window call stop()?
_   need to make sure hitting stop button and closing window explicitly call
_   set finished to true, then join() the animation thread
_ dispose handlers not called when stop button pressed
_   https://github.com/processing/processing/issues/4445
_ need to set dock icon title on osx


PDE / Tweak

_ TweakMode listener mess in JavaTextArea
_   https://github.com/processing/processing/issues/4605


PDE / Sketch & Sketchbook

_ Large number of files in sketchbook folder can cause slow startup
_   and/or errors with launch4j
_   https://github.com/processing/processing/issues/1190
_ error that sketch is read-only can't be canceled
_   hitting cancel (or ESC?) still brings up the save dialog
_ ArticulatePrint-070103a.pde from ArticulatePrint-070103a loads ok
_   but when opening the sketch, it leaves out the file
_   because there's a dash in the name
_   and instead only loads StemCell.pde
_ show progress dialog during export and save
_ hitting ESC on "create this, move file, continue" opened anyway

TOOLS / General

_ create default tools folder (just like libraries)
_ for tools, maybe don't run on event thread? (makes the gui hang)
_   but instead, things that affect gui need to be called w/ invokeLater?


TOOLS / Ideas

_ eclipse import/export
_   simple mechanism to export to eclipse
_     don't worry about subversion stuff, just export with libraries
_   something clever to import back from eclipse
_   could keep the .svn files in with the libs and all
_   then when exporting for eclipse, people can update as necessary
_   -> dan et al say better to do fixed versions and have it work simply
_ import sketch from url (takes a zip from archive sketch)
_ archive sketch direct to bug report
_ shared code
_   Integrator / FloatThing / CameraStuff -- Update
_   to pull code from a local folder
_   update will update classes from shared in the current folder


TOOLS / Auto Format

_ Switch block cases not indented
_   https://github.com/processing/processing/issues/1042
_ do a better job of maintaining cursor
_ only auto-format a particular section of code
_   set the 'tabs' var based on how many spaces on previous line
_   http://processing.org/discourse/yabb/YaBB.cgi?board=Proce55ing_Software;action=display;num=1087227217

_   http://processing.org/discourse/yabb_beta/YaBB.cgi?board=VideoCamera;action=display;num=1116850328#3


LIBRARIES / Net

_ modernize Client/Server code to use synchronized lists
_   do we let people use the public vars in Server and Client?
_   are they documented?

FUTURE

Notes for some indefinite later release...

_ make reference build process part of dist
_   https://github.com/processing/processing-docs/issues/85
_   separate ant target, but only require them for dist
_   as separate targets, folks can build explicitly if they'd like
_   processing-docs/java_generate/ReferenceGenerator/processingrefBuild.sh
_   remove reference.zip from main repo
_ nurbs or other architecture stuff
_ force indentation - implement an option for beginners especially
_ indents and loops
_   or make the area light up gray as it's being worked on
_ get rid of static mode? only setup/draw mode? or create project that way?
_   pro: simplify internal code, fixes some of the worst errors
_   con: people love it, most of the books use it heavily
_ add === for String.equals()
_   might be problematic since it might be opposite the javascript meaning
_   jer: it's a decent time to start talking abt references/vars
_ Blank sketch opened even if opening an existing sketch by double-clicking
_   https://github.com/processing/processing/issues/218
_ changing number of screens between run causes things to show up off-screen
_   so when running, check to make sure that things are out of the area
_ improve the speed of file copying
_   use FileChannels, see FileInputStream.getChannel(),
_   and use transferFrom() or transferTo().)
_   could also use FileUtils in Apache's common io
_   http://commons.apache.org/io/api-release/index.html
_ go through libraries and clean things up
protected void finalize() throws Throwable {
  try {
    close();
  } catch (Exception e) {
    // do something
  } finally {
    super.finalize();
    // more code can be written here as per need of application
  }
}
