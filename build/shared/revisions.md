# Processing 4.0.1

*Revision 1286 – 9 August 2022*

And what sort of anniversary would it be without a regression that breaks a major feature? Ahem. Here's 4.0.1…

* In the 4.0 release, switching to p5.js Mode caused an error message to pop up. Now fixed. [#530](https://github.com/processing/processing4/issues/530)

* One minor addition: in the Preferences window, clicking the “More preferences can be found…” text will open the [wiki page](https://github.com/processing/processing4/wiki/Preferences) with more details about all these wonderful options.

Other than that, please see the release notes for 4.0…


# Processing 4.0

*Revision 1285 – 9 August 2022*

On the 21st anniversary of the very first Processing release (revision 0001), we're posting the final 4.0, which is the 286th release of the software.

The primary goal for Processing 4 is to keep everyone's code running, even as operating systems, hardware, and hairlines continue to change.

There are really too many changes to list, but you can start by reading about them [at this link](https://github.com/processing/processing4/wiki/Changes-in-4.0).

Below is a list of the incremental changes in this release since beta 9 a few days ago:


## welcome, welcome!

* Added a new “Welcome” screen that links to a couple examples as well as the changes and updates page.

* The splash screen has also been updated with a new image for 4.0.


## wait, what?

* Export to Application was almost completely broken on macOS, where all apps were reporting as “damaged” when transferred to another machine. It's now working again, and also prompts users to install the Xcode tools. See the [wiki](https://github.com/processing/processing4/wiki/Exporting-Applications#macos) for more information about how to work with Apple's code signing restrictions.

* There was a *lot* of out-of-date material on the wiki pages in the Processing 3 repository on Github. We now have new versions of the major pages in the Processing 4 repository. This includes pages on [Themes](https://github.com/processing/processing4/wiki/Themes), [Supported Platforms](https://github.com/processing/processing4/wiki/Supported-Platforms), [Exporting Applications](https://github.com/processing/processing4/wiki/Exporting-Applications), [Troubleshooting](https://github.com/processing/processing4/wiki/Troubleshooting), and the [FAQ](https://github.com/processing/processing4/wiki/FAQ).

* There are many entries in `preferences.txt` that are important, but not important enough to make it into the Preferences window. Some of those are now documented [here](https://github.com/processing/processing4/wiki/Preferences).

* Processing sometimes creates a *lot* of temporary files (basically, each time you run a sketch), which didn't always get cleaned up by the operating system. With 4.0, those are all being written to a separate “processing” folder, so that they can be automatically removed after 7 days. [#529](https://github.com/processing/processing4/issues/529)


## the last of the bugs

* When using Export to Application, errors in the code would cause the software to just report “error during export.” Now it provides the usual error message (about the error itself).

* The dropdown menu in the Theme Selector wasn't updating properly when new themes were selected.

* The rollover and pressed color for the console scrollbar was always blue.

* Inside Movie Maker, `ffmpeg` wasn't available on all platforms, that's now fixed. We've also updated to version 5.0.1.


## you probably won't notice

* Examples have been updated, and are now being pulled from the [processing-examples](https://github.com/processing/processing-examples) repository. May have also had to remove the sin/cos lookup tables from the Rotating Arcs example so that we could comfortably put it on the Welcome screen.

* Compress `jdk/Contents/Home/legal` into a single zip. It was 300 files, or 60% of the 500 files in the entire JDK. Lawyers FTW.


# Processing 4.0 beta 9

*Revision 1284 – 4 August 2022*

Getting very close to 4.0! Just a bit more now…


## design, design, design

Perhaps most noticeable, this release includes a ton of refinement on the design.

* Another set of 16 themes, these with gradients, have been added to the Theme Selector. Have fun!

* If you've changed the theme in a previous beta, it will be reset the first time you use beta 9, because of major updates to theme handling (many new parameters, others renamed and cleaned up). Relatedly, changing the theme no longer writes a `theme.txt` file to your sketchbook folder.

* Added options to the Theme Selector to write `theme.txt` to your sketchbook folder (so you can make manual edits), and also to reload the theme dynamically (after you've made changes).

* Lots of minor fixes to typography and layout of elements. Hopefully you'll agree that the changes add up to things feeling a lot better.

* We're now using [FlatLaf](https://www.formdev.com/flatlaf/) to improve the look and feel of dialog boxes and other components that we've not customized ourselves.

* Nearly all PNG-based icons and interface elements have been replaced by SVGs that are automatically re-rendered to match the theme when it changes.

* The base font being used is now part of the language translation, because specific fonts are required for non-Roman languages, or languages that are not supported by the Source Sans 3 that we use everywhere else. This also helps us get the language-specific overrides for Chinese, Japanese, Korean, Greek, and Arabic out of the code and into something that can be updated more easily.

* The Preferences window has had a major facelift. It was giving me great anxiety. It was so, so ugly. It is now less ugly.

* The Contributions Manager is now themed and cleaned up to match the rest of the interface.

* We're replacing the underscores in tab names with spaces. It looks a little nicer with the default sketch naming. If you'd like to keep underscores, open `preferences.txt` and set `sketch.name.replace_underscore = false`.

* Updated the scroll bars to match the theme. [#265](https://github.com/processing/processing4/issues/265)

* New icon buttons for the status bar instead of hacky emojis. The clipboard icon even changes to a search icon when holding down shift!

* Implement 2x versions of the icons for the debugger window/variable inspector. [#3921](https://github.com/processing/processing/issues/3921)

* Taken collectively, these are the visual design changes for 4.0. [#48](https://github.com/processing/processing4/issues/48)


## new features

* New sketch naming schemes! For those who didn't enjoy the sketch plus underscore plus six digit date, your time has come. Visit the Preferences window and behold the naming options available in the dropdown menu. You can now use the “Friendly” naming scheme that folks seem to love, as well as a pair of other less serious alternatives. [#6045](https://github.com/processing/processing/issues/6045), [#6048](https://github.com/processing/processing/pull/6048), [#144](https://github.com/processing/processing4/pull/144)

* It's also possible to create your own naming schemes. Create a file named `naming.json` in your sketchbook folder that follows the same layout in the Processing download. Provide a name, a list of prefixes, and a list of suffixes just like that file. Save it and restart Processing, and your new option will be available in the dropdown.


## other big ones

* We should be fully set for Apple Silicon (i.e. M1 and M2) support. [#128](https://github.com/processing/processing4/issues/128)

* Code completion stopped working between beta 4 and beta 5. Now it's back. [#491](https://github.com/processing/processing4/issues/491)


## community contributions!

* Double-clicking a `.pde` file also opens an untitled/empty sketch. [#477](https://github.com/processing/processing4/issues/477), [#479](https://github.com/processing/processing4/pull/479), [#218](https://github.com/processing/processing/issues/218)

* Updates to the Spanish translation. [#480](https://github.com/processing/processing4/pull/480), [#481](https://github.com/processing/processing4/pull/481)

* Updates to the German translation. [#483](https://github.com/processing/processing4/pull/483)

* Add `flatlaf.jar` to `config.xml` on Windows. [#498](https://github.com/processing/processing4/pull/498)

* Fix parsing of java error messages containing ":" [#492](https://github.com/processing/processing4/issues/492), [#493](https://github.com/processing/processing4/pull/493)

* Exported applications were giving `java.lang.ClassNotFoundException: --full-screen` errors. [#488](https://github.com/processing/processing4/issues/488), [#502](https://github.com/processing/processing4/pull/502).

* Editor was treating {} brackets as code when they're inside a String, char or comment. [#444](https://github.com/processing/processing4/issues/444), [#504](https://github.com/processing/processing4/pull/504)

* Add extra Java arguments to enable anti-aliasing for KDE users. [#513](https://github.com/processing/processing4/pull/513), [reference](https://docs.oracle.com/javase/7/docs/technotes/guides/2d/flags.html#aaFonts)


## bug fixes

* Fix “Unable to load Java Runtime Environment” errors on Apple Silicon machines. [#526](https://github.com/processing/processing4/issues/526)

* Updated the Help menu entries to make sure they're going to the right locations for 4.x. As with the reference, links are no longer local (see [#524](https://github.com/processing/processing4/issues/524)).

* Help → Libraries Reference and Help → Tools Reference submenu items were broken. [#5839](https://github.com/processing/processing/issues/5839)


## data updates

* Added `random()` method to the `XxxxList` classes to return a random value from the list.

* Added `getXxxxList()` methods to `JSONObject`

* Added `toXxxxList()` methods to `JSONArray`

* Renamed `getXxxArray()` to `toXxxArray()` in `JSONArray` for consistency. The old versions are still available, but deprecated.

* Switch to `toArray()` instead of `array()` in the `XxxxList` classes. Did not deprecate old version because it was actually broken.

* Lots of cleanup (and some bug fixing) in the `XxxxList` classes.


## internal changes

* Bumped the Java version to 17.0.4+8.

* If you get a “core does not run on this architecture” when running from the source, you may need to run `ant clean-jogl` inside `core`.

* Also added a `clean-libs` target to `build.xml` files that need it. This will re-download libraries that we rely upon like JOGL, Batik, Ant, and others.

* Cleaned up several files in the download, the footprint should be a few dozen megabytes smaller.

* Updated to the latest version of JNA (5.12.1) for better Apple Silicon support.

* All the remaining ancient bug URLs (Bugzilla and Google Code) have been updated and removed from the source. The Google Code issues are re-linked to their Github equivalents, and the old Bugzilla pages have been [revived](https://download.processing.org/bugzilla/) since their disappearance last August.


## known issues

* We've had to remove the offline version of the reference that was accessible from the Help menu. We hope to bring it back some day. [#524](https://github.com/processing/processing4/issues/524)

* The mixed mode warning is temporarily missing. [#519](https://github.com/processing/processing4/issues/519)

* `color` in imports shows up as an error, but code still compiles and runs. [#521](https://github.com/processing/processing4/issues/521)

* Need to make it possible to use “module” jars so that other JavaFX classes can be imported. [#522](https://github.com/processing/processing4/issues/522), [#15](https://github.com/processing/processing4-javafx/issues/15)


# Processing 4.0 beta 8

*Revision 1283 – 23 April 2022*

Lots of fixes! OpenGL on M1! Exclamation points!


## the big ones

* OpenGL now working on Apple Silicon! Many thanks to user @jaegonlee who provided the last [few](https://github.com/jzy3d/jogl/pull/17/files) [tweaks](https://github.com/jzy3d/jogl/pull/16/files) to get a build working. [#370](https://github.com/processing/processing4/issues/370).

* Lots of work on how Modes are handled in the Contributions Manager to make it less… quirky. This will be a huge upgrade if you're a user of Python Mode, p5jsMode, Android Mode, and others.


## a whole mess of useful fixes contributed by @TN8001

* Fix text caret position shifts when typing Japanese. [#447](https://github.com/processing/processing4/issues/447), [#462](https://github.com/processing/processing4/pull/462)

* Some keys couldn't be entered on the On-Screen Keyboard. [#403](https://github.com/processing/processing4/issues/403), [#461](https://github.com/processing/processing4/pull/461)

* Fix error in Tweak Mode when using underscores in numbers. [#442](https://github.com/processing/processing4/issues/442), [#459](https://github.com/processing/processing4/pull/459)

* Fix IDE auto-formatting confused by method references. [#279](https://github.com/processing/processing4/issues/279), [#436](https://github.com/processing/processing4/pull/436)


## semi-noticeable fixes and changes

* Set minimum size for the scroll bar thumb. [#473](https://github.com/processing/processing4/issues/473)

* Change to "Modes..." or "Manage Modes..." and same for Libraries, etc

* A few fixes for `fullScreen()`. [#474](https://github.com/processing/processing4/pull/474), [#471](https://github.com/processing/processing4/issues/471)


## minor bug fixes and changes

* Fix logic for opening the correct “main” tab in `handleOpen()`.

* Dropping folder into sketch window throws weird exception. [#441](https://github.com/processing/processing4/issues/441)

* Fix `  does not exist` message on Linux startup. (The startup script was passing a blank sketch file name to the software.)

* Support multiple files being opened from the command line on Linux.

* Only show `setWritable()` failure in recent.txt when it is a problem

* Fix `NullPointerException` when changing the theme. [#476](https://github.com/processing/processing4/issues/476)

* Suppress `java.lang.NoSuchMethodError: accessibilityHitTest` error in the console. [#368](https://github.com/processing/processing4/issues/368)

* Internal change for preprocessor to support Android Mode. [#470](https://github.com/processing/processing4/pull/470), [#469](https://github.com/processing/processing4/issues/469)

* `filter()` calls with high pixel density in OpenGL were making a tiny texture. [#429](https://github.com/processing/processing4/issues/429), [#433](https://github.com/processing/processing4/pull/433)

* Renamed parameters controlling GL buffer settings. [#435](https://github.com/processing/processing4/pull/435)

* Finalizing buffer object streaming changes to `PShape` when used with OpenGL. [#196](https://github.com/processing/processing4/issues/196)


## lots of work on the contributions manager

* Fix frequent “Error during download and install of Python Mode for Processing” message. [#5918](https://github.com/processing/processing/issues/5918), [#445](https://github.com/processing/processing4/issues/445)

* Manager fails to complete install of PythonMode when no windows open. [#5309](https://github.com/processing/processing/issues/5309), [#446](https://github.com/processing/processing4/issues/446)

* Allow update of the current Mode. This was causing confusion because you'd otherwise have to arbitrarily switch to another Mode to run an update, even if you never otherwise used it.

* Laying the basic groundwork for theme updates.

* Removing the current Mode (with no windows open) was causing an exception.

* Fix `NullPointerException` when clicking Update All on the Updates tab. [#440](https://github.com/processing/processing4/issues/440)

* Switch to using https to get retrieve the contributions listing.

* Remove overbuilt, undocumented search features in Contributions Manager. No more regex, but accents and others work properly now.

* Lots of cleaning out old code in the contrib manager guts. Rewrote category tallying for contribs. This was also hiding an issue that caused contribs to be re-added several times. Removed the “restart” flag because it was never used. Cleaned up accessors and other internal muck for how `processing.app.contrib` classes interact with one another.


# Processing 4.0 beta 7

*Revision 1282 – 3 March 2022*

The main thing for this release is to prevent an issue where files might be deleted (!) due to the change in beta 6.

…it also rolls back a change that broke Python Mode. Sorry, snake people!

…but also: a new feature! A very cool new feature! See below.


## Regression Repair

* Bring back `getMainProgram()` for Python Mode. [#409](https://github.com/processing/processing4/issues/409)

* Fix an issue where opening a single .pde file in an unrelated folder (i.e. Downloads) would delete the entire folder when deleting the "sketch" without being 100% obvious what it was doing. [#424](https://github.com/processing/processing4/issues/424)

* Andrés tracked down the problem with `POINTS` and `PShape` that was introduced in 4.0 beta 3. [#345](https://github.com/processing/processing4/issues/345), [#432](https://github.com/processing/processing4/pull/432)


## I'm just here for the ratio

Added a new `windowRatio(width, height)` function that remaps screen and mouse coordinates to the specified aspect ratio.

The general idea is that you set a ratio, and whether you're using `fullScreen()` or `setResizable(true)`, the sketch will scale its coordinates (and the coordinates of the mouse to fit that same ratio.

For instance, use `windowRatio(1280, 720)` in your code, and then all your coordinates will be re-mapped to that range—but always keeping the aspect ratio. Probably easiest to see by running this sketch:

```processing
void setup() {
  windowResizable(true);
  windowRatio(1280, 720);

  cursor(CROSS);
  strokeWeight(10);
}

void draw() {
  background(240);
  fill(255);
  rect(0, 0, rwidth, rheight);

  fill(0);
  textAlign(CENTER, CENTER);
  textSize(200);
  text(rmouseX + ", " + rmouseY, rwidth/2, rheight/2);
}
```

When using `windowRatio()`, the new `rwidth` and `rheight` variables contain the width and height that were passed to `windowRatio()` and can be used in place of `width` and `height` elsewhere in your code.

Similarly, `rmouseX` and `rmouseY` contain the mouse position, scaled by the current ratio.

If your window is taller (or wider) than the specified ratio, your sketch will be moved (using `translate()` to fit the space, and `rmouseX` and `rmouseY` might even have negative values if they're outside the box. (Again, try running the code above.)

The exact amount of space that's extra can be found in the `ratioLeft` and `ratioTop` variables. And the current `scale()` being used for the ratio can be found in `ratioScale`.

Mind you, it might be tempting to use windowRatio(16, 9), but keep in mind that means your horizontal coordinates will be numbers between 0 and (almost) 16, and vertical will be between 0 and 9. Not a great way to work! (And at some point, likely to introduce quirks as you learn about the shortcomings of floating point number accuracy.)


## Minor Mites

* Half a dozen other fixes/changes for opening sketches and how it identifies the Mode and the rest. If you notice anything weird, let us know asap.

* Rewrote our native code for going full screen on macOS, retiring jAppleMenuBar after a decade of service. Also gets things working on Apple Silicon.

* Prevent “You must first install tweak Mode to use this sketch” when using sketches that date back to 2.0. [#415](https://github.com/processing/processing4/issues/415)

* Swap more uses of `Util.deleteFile()` and move files to the Trash (or Recycle Bin) instead. This can make more mess, but it reduces the chances of something bad happening when Processing deletes a file.

* Change straight quotes to smart quotes in the `PDE.properties` file. This just means that more UI and error messages will have nicer quotes.


# Processign 4.0 beta 6

*Revision 1281 – 13 February 2022*

Continuing the unintentional tradition of Processing releases on [Super Bowl Sundays](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Super_Bowl_Sunday), here's beta 6.


## Scaling and stretching on Windows

* Windows scaling at 125% was stretching sketches to make them look crusty. [#378](https://github.com/processing/processing4/issues/378)

* `pixelDensity()` not working in exported Windows applications. [#5414](https://github.com/processing/processing/issues/5414#issuecomment-841088518)

* Implement sketch scaling in `PApplet` so that they take UI sizing into account. [#4897](https://github.com/processing/processing/issues/4897), [#4894](https://github.com/processing/processing/issues/4894)

These changes also include some extra native code on Windows, which is described in detail [here](https://github.com/processing/processing4/tree/master/build/windows/fenster).


## Hell freezes over

For those of you that use Git (or other version control) this release includes an experimental(!) feature that lets you separate the name of the sketch from the name of the main tab. This means that you can use "Save As…" and it won't rename the file for the main tab. *Or* you can rename a sketch folder and the sketch inside will still work properly.

Uncheck the “Keep sketch name and main tab in sync” option in Preferences, and you're on your way. This is a *major* change to some of the oldest code in the PDE. If it has bugs, it may eat code. **Use with caution and report any issues you see immediately!**

Again, please help test this feature and [file issues](https://github.com/processing/processing4/issues/new) if you run into trouble.


## Bug fixes

* Actually set the correct names for the `windowMove()` and `windowResize()` functions that were announced in beta 5. [#53](https://github.com/processing/processing4/issues/53)

* PDF export not working with Processing 4.0 beta 5. [#395](https://github.com/processing/processing4/issues/395)

* Lots of issues discovered when making the sketch naming change. For instance, it looks like it was sometimes necessary to twice select the Mode for Android sketches. Also sorts out issues with when `sketch.properties` was or was not written.

* Fix `NullPointerException` on first use of Export to Application.

* RGB image created with `createImage()` has alpha channel. [#388](https://github.com/processing/processing4/issues/388)

* `CODED` is inconsistent between the default renderer and P2D/P3D. [#376](https://github.com/processing/processing4/issues/376)

* Fix multi-line strings not terminating properly. [#398](https://github.com/processing/processing4/issues/398), [#400](https://github.com/processing/processing4/pull/400)

* Clean up text sizes in the warning dialog box shown when sketch files change outside the Editor.

* Clean up error text in the console that showed up when sketch files removed from a sketch while it was still open (after the user was asked about them).


## Minor changes

* Fix up “Display N does not exist, using the default display instead” message. If more than one display, shows list of available displays (size and index).

* Move "Add Examples" to bottom of the Examples window

* Change cmd-click in window title to point to sketch folder, not the main PDE.


## Things you're less likely to notice

* Updated to Java 17.0.2+8. We hope this may fix the `java.lang.NoSuchMethodError: accessibilityHitTest` error. [#408](https://github.com/processing/processing4/issues/408)

* Removed anachronistic `Preferences.save()` that happened after opening a sketch.


## Until further notice

**The macOS-aarch64 (Apple Silicon) release is not yet complete. If you want to use P2D and P3D (OpenGL) on macOS, use the Intel (x86_64) build, which is the only one that will be linked from processing.org/download until this situation is resolved.** See [\#370](https://github.com/processing/processing4/issues/370) for status updates.


# Processing 4.0 beta 5

*Revision 1280 – 3 February 2022*

Tomorrow morning is the first day of using Processing in class, so I thought I'd add some chaos to that by posting a release the night before. Having started the first day of class being locked out of the classroom, I'm just looking for ways to keep the students from getting too comfortable.


## Things you might notice in this release

* We've hopefully finally, *finally*, _finally_ fixed the problems with the text caret position. [\#194](https://github.com/processing/processing4/issues/194), [\#226](https://github.com/processing/processing4/issues/226), and [\#342](https://github.com/processing/processing4/issues/342)

* Syntax coloring updates based on the themes, mostly for the darker varieties.

* Added “Refresh” and “Show Folder” buttons to the bottom of the sketchbook window. Also cleaned up some of the guts to make it faster and less… quirky.

* Several fixes for resizing windows: P2D and P3D sketches should flicker red less, and the `NullPointerException`s when resizing sketches with the default renderer should be resolved. [\#386](https://github.com/processing/processing4/issues/386), [\#162](https://github.com/processing/processing4/issues/162), [\#4129](https://github.com/processing/processing/issues/4129), and [\#186](https://github.com/processing/processing4/issues/186)

* When running a sketch, it shows the “Play” icon instead of the Processing icon for its windows (just like it does when running an exported application).


## Out with the old…

* The twenty year old (and sometimes buggy) TIFF reader/writer has been removed, so Java's internal ImageIO is now used for TIFF files. The code is slightly slower, but the saved files are more compatible, and `loadImage("blah.tif")` will also work on more files than in the past.

* Also, image file names passed to `save()` and `saveFrame()` must have an extension. We are no longer adding `.tif` to files with no extension, because that can lead to confusing results, and the behavior is inconsistent with the rest of the API.

* Rewrote the ten year old (since we're keeping track of these things) code that handles `fullScreen()` to get it working on Apple Silicon. [\#221](https://github.com/processing/processing4/issues/221) and [\#372](https://github.com/processing/processing4/issues/372)


## Sam fixing up the preprocessor

* Several bug fixes to the preprocessor. [\#384](https://github.com/processing/processing4/pull/384)

* Better error message when mixing "active" (with setup and draw) and "static" (no function definitions) code styles. [\#290](https://github.com/processing/processing4/issues/290)

* Fix problem with function `size(int, int)` in classes. [\#317](https://github.com/processing/processing4/issues/317)

* Add (provisional) support for multi-line string text blocks. [\#371](https://github.com/processing/processing4/issues/371)

* `fullScreen()` when specifying the display number was broken. [\#352](https://github.com/processing/processing4/issues/352) and [\#392](https://github.com/processing/processing4/pull/392)


## Feature improvements in progress

* Adding core functions to replace the `surface` methods:
    * `surface.setSize(w, h)` now available as `windowResize(w, h)`
    * `surface.setResizable()` is now `windowResizable()`
    * `surface.setLocation(x, y)` is now `windowMove(x, y)`
    * `surface.setTitle()` is now `windowTitle()`

    There are also new event handlers `windowResized()` and `windowMoved()` that are called when the sketch window is resized or moved. We may still tweak the naming and behavior of these a little (consider these an "alpha" feature), but it's progress. [\#53](https://github.com/processing/processing4/issues/53)

* Added necessary infrastructure to support language translations in Modes. [\#236](https://github.com/processing/processing4/issues/236), [\#237](https://github.com/processing/processing4/pull/237), [\#2833](https://github.com/processing/processing/pull/2833), [\#3154](https://github.com/processing/processing/issues/3154), and [\#3337](https://github.com/processing/processing/pull/3337)

* Plumbing is in place to set the DPI of PNG images and the compression level of JPEG images. Though we still need some API for it.


## Plumbing you probably won't notice

* Several changes to how image saving is handled. There were lots of ways this could go wrong, this gets rid of several of them. Hopefully no new regressions!

* Tweaked how URLs are opened for better compatibility on different operating systems.

* Debugging failed installation of `.pdez` files.


# Processing 4.0 beta 4

*Revision 1279 – 24 January 2022*

Loooots of changes under the hood to better support more platforms. And by that, we mean Apple Silicon (now in alpha!) and Raspberry Pi devices (once again). And whatever else gets cooked up in the coming years.

For the Windows users, the scaling issues have finally been sorted out. Use 125% and 250% and whatever weird Windows scaling you want, and it will work. You can safely uncheck the “Disable HiDPI scaling” checkbox in Preferences.

Against my better judgement, I'm posting a release that's native for Apple Silicon. OpenGL is currently broken. Sketches crash immediately. You should only use it if you're a masochist. Or a masochist that likes *extremely fast* but very incomplete software, and won't file bug reports saying “OpenGL is broken.” But it's being posted for folks who do not need OpenGL, and/or want to help debug. [\#370](https://github.com/processing/processing4/issues/370)

We've also moved the FX2D (JavaFX) renderer to its own library, which is available from the Contributions Manager. In related news, the download size is now 230 MB instead of 493 MB.


## New features!

* New downloads for Apple Silicon (incomplete! [\#128](https://github.com/processing/processing4/issues/128)), and Raspberry Pi (32- and 64-bit). Some things are still broken, so the releases will be on Github but not processing.org/download.

* The design continues coming together, with new icons for exported applications, document files (`.pde`, `.pdex`, and `.pdez`), plus the Foundation icon used in the Contributions Manager. This work is still in progress, at least until [\#48](https://github.com/processing/processing4/issues/48) is closed.

* Re-implement settings.path to support portable versions. [\#3948](https://github.com/processing/processing/issues/3948), [362](https://github.com/processing/processing4/issues/362), [\#360](https://github.com/processing/processing4/pull/360), fixed with [1a49263a](https://github.com/processing/processing4/commit/1a49263a94a2d7af2b4686286406f7896d207cd9)


## We're all regressing, why can't your software?

* Double-clicking .pde files on macOS was broken in beta 3. [\#347](https://github.com/processing/processing4/issues/347)

* PShape not allowing attibutes of type `int`. [\#344](https://github.com/processing/processing4/issues/344), [\#363](https://github.com/processing/processing4/pull/363)

* Using `P2D` with `createShape()` causing `GLException`. [\#353](https://github.com/processing/processing4/issues/353), [\#367](https://github.com/processing/processing4/pull/367)

* Fix error in internal utility function to invert scaling. [\#366](https://github.com/processing/processing4/issues/366), [\#217](https://github.com/processing/processing4/issues/217), [\#367](https://github.com/processing/processing4/pull/367)


## Other fixes…

* Tons of work to get the Windows version of the application to scale properly. Even the opening splash screen is behaving better. [\#342](https://github.com/processing/processing4/issues/342)

* `displayDensity()` was returning 1 when run from the PDE on Windows. [\#339](https://github.com/processing/processing4/issues/339)

* Fix "Could not delete disable_hidpi" message that was showing up on macOS and Linux after closing the Preferences window.

* Major work inside the Contributions Manager: links to projects, links in description text now working. Some fixes to speed things up. Removing hundreds of lines of vestigial code. Fix the font being used on the progress bar.

* Removed "Illegal reflective access" warning on Linux. [\#207](https://github.com/processing/processing4/issues/207)


## Changes

* Native libraries for OpenGL are no longer packed inside `.jar` files. This fixes slowdowns on Windows caused by antivirus software kicking into high gear. It also gives us a path to get OpenGL working on Apple Silicon. Unfortunately, this also means you'll need to set `java.library.path` in an IDE outside the PDE. [\#4783](https://github.com/processing/processing/issues/4783#issuecomment-269328168), [\#4239](https://github.com/processing/processing/issues/4239), [JOGL](https://jogamp.org/bugzilla/show_bug.cgi?id=1301), [Stack Overflow](https://stackoverflow.com/a/51100411)

* JavaFX moved to its own library. It no longer works with Tools and Modes as a result, but it was just too hefty relative to its importance. Read about it in [\#348](https://github.com/processing/processing4/issues/348)

* A massive amount of work for our supported platforms. Some of the gritty details are [here](https://github.com/processing/processing4/wiki/Supported-Platforms) but we have six of them. Export to Application has been rewritten. It's now possible to build Processing on all six of these platforms.

* Cross-platform support for native libraries has also changed significantly. The `export.txt` file is ignored completely (no libraries required it anyway), and the subfolders names for native libraries have changed. See the layout of `core/library` for an example. Again, this enables all these platforms from Apple Silicon to Raspberry Pi.


## Contributed tidbits

* Select the entire line when doing Edit → Copy on an empty selection. [\#100](https://github.com/processing/processing4/pull/100)


## You probably won't notice, but it's noted here in case you do

* Set the minimum Java version for Windows launcher to 17.0.1.

* Bumped Ant from 1.10.10 to 1.10.12.

* Upgraded JNA from 5.8.0 to 5.10.0.

* Spent a bunch of time looking into RSyntaxArea. It's not gonna happen. [\#355](https://github.com/processing/processing4/issues/355), [\#3199](https://github.com/processing/processing/issues/3199), and [the details](https://github.com/processing/processing4/blob/master/app/src/processing/app/syntax/README.md).


# Processing 4.0 beta 3

*Revision 1278 – 15 January 2022*

New colors in the UI! We're still making changes to the design of the UI, but this release includes a new theme engine that makes it possible to select interface colors from a set of options, as well as more control over choosing your own schemes. Check out Tools → Theme Selector for the magic.

We've also moved to Java 17, fixed lots of bugs, added a new default color scheme, and implemented better support for multiple windows with OpenGL.

We even updated the loading screen to include 2022 in the copyright notice.


## Fixing the bugs that won't fix themselves

* Added an option to “Disable HiDPI Scaling” on Windows for users that were having trouble with the editor caret (cursor) showing up in the wrong position, or text in the interface (on the tabs in particular) looking oddly jagged. [\#226](https://github.com/processing/processing4/issues/226), [\#231](https://github.com/processing/processing4/issues/231)

* The “Disable HiDPI Scaling” option is a temporary workaround, with ongoing development taking place at [\#342](https://github.com/processing/processing4/issues/342). There's also a console warning if Processing detects that your display may have issues, however it's nearly impossible to do this with certainty. As a result, we can't enable the option by default, because it would make things worse for users who don't need it. Fixing this issue requires spending a lot of time testing different Windows systems, resolutions, monitor setups, etc.

* Too much writing to the console (from both System.out and System.err) causing the software to lock up completely. [\#338](https://github.com/processing/processing4/issues/338)

* Got rollovers working again for the Toolbar buttons. Somewhat comically, these seem to have broken at some point during the 3.x development process, and nobody noticed.

* Fix a problem where the default font would misbehave after `textSize()` was called. Turns out the problem was that the wrong font was being used in the first place. But also added a warning for users when unsupported characters are used with the default font. [\#303](https://github.com/processing/processing4/issues/303), [\#4956](https://github.com/processing/processing/issues/4956)

* `listFiles()` and `listPaths()` with an extension specified were not properly matching directories.

* Fix for `disableStyle()` with 2D shapes in `P3D`.

* Allow `GEOMETRY` (not just `PATH`) with `contains()` in PShape. The `contains()` method is still imperfect, but it's just as bad with polygon shapes as path shapes.

* The Open/Save dialog box was crashing on Linux. Can't reproduce with this release, which uses Adoptium OpenJDK 17, so fingers crossed that it's resolved. [\#306](https://github.com/processing/processing4/issues/306)


## Known Issues, the thorns that remain in our side

* The included version of the documentation is for 3.0, not the newer 4.0.

* The display scaling issues on Windows need to be resolved without folks having to use Preferences. [\#342](https://github.com/processing/processing4/issues/342)

* …aaaand pretty much anything [here](https://github.com/processing/processing4/issues?q=is%3Aissue+is%3Aopen+sort%3Aupdated-desc) and [here](https://github.com/processing/processing/issues?q=is%3Aissue+is%3Aopen+sort%3Aupdated-desc). Please help!


## Major internal work to support UI themes

* As mentioned above, several new themes are available from the “Theme Selector” option in the Tools menu. Selecting a theme will create a `theme.txt` file in your sketchbook that sets the interface colors.

* If you make changes to the `theme.txt` file in your sketchbook, you can select Tools → Update Theme to see those changes reflected in the interface. If there's no `theme.txt` file in your sketchbook, it will create a `theme.txt` file in your sketchbook, which you can edit. After you've saved your changes, select “Update Theme” again to see the updates.

* Selecting a new theme will resave your `theme.txt` file under a new name (`theme.001`, `theme.002`, etc.)

* Now using custom scrollbar widgets in the Editor so that it can better match the rest of the interface.

* Auto-generating toolbar and tab icons from SVG files based on theme colors.

* Implement automatic update for changes to `theme.txt` in the sketchbook.

* More documentation about all of this soon, which will live [here](https://github.com/processing/processing4/wiki/Themes).


## Hark, a sound from the West, and it is Sam

* Error when calling `smooth()` on `PGraphics` [\#272](https://github.com/processing/processing4/issues/272)

* Detect if calling special methods on `PApplet` or not (and restore unit tests) [\#288](https://github.com/processing/processing4/pull/288)

* Move Mockito to a new version. [\#287](https://github.com/processing/processing4/issues/287)


## Behold, a sound from the East, and it is Andrés

* Finalizing support for multiple windows with OpenGL. [\#312](https://github.com/processing/processing4/issues/312), [\#313](https://github.com/processing/processing4/pull/313)

* Implement buffer object streaming for `P2D` and `P3D` and finalize attribute API in `PShape`. [\#314](https://github.com/processing/processing4/pull/314)

* Add support to `PATH` shapes in `P2D` renderer. [\#6009](https://github.com/processing/processing/issues/6009), [\#316](https://github.com/processing/processing4/pull/316)


## The community continues pitching in

* Update Ukrainian language strings. [\#301](https://github.com/processing/processing4/pull/301)

* Splash screen has default OpenJDK icon. [\#297](https://github.com/processing/processing4/issues/297), [\#329](https://github.com/processing/processing4/pull/329)


## Maintaining this 20~~0~~-year-old house

* Use UTF-8 for `readString()` and `write()` in net client. Avoids platform-specific behavior; Java 18 also making UTF-8 the default. [\#336](https://github.com/processing/processing4/issues/336)

* Cleaning up the Create Font dialog while tracking down [\#278](https://github.com/processing/processing4/issues/278). Removed `Serif`, `SansSerif`, `Monospaced`, `Dialog`, `DialogInput` from Create Font. Also sorting the list of font names, and skipping fonts that start with `.` or `#` because they're supposed to be hidden from users.


## Internal build and development changes

* Update [appbundler](https://github.com/TheInfiniteKind/appbundler) with the latest from upstream.

* Replace JDK 11 and JavaFX 16 with JDK 17 and JavaFX 17. [\#285](https://github.com/processing/processing4/issues/285)

* Move up from JavaFX 17.0.0.1 to 17.0.1.

* Get rid of version numbers in the name of the `batik.jar` file.

* `ffmpeg` not downloading correctly on M1 machines. [\#319](https://github.com/processing/processing4/issues/319), [\#5775](https://github.com/processing/processing/issues/5775), [\#5714](https://github.com/processing/processing/issues/5714), [\#6230](https://github.com/processing/processing/issues/6230)


# Processing 4.0 beta 2

*Revision 1277 – 4 October 2021*

Had to put things down for a while after the big push to get beta 1 out the door. But now we're back with an update mostly focused on fixing a few things that were broken.


## Lots of fixes

* Export to Application no longer broken when using P2D or P3D on macOS. (Though if you're a macOS developer, we could [use some help](https://github.com/processing/processing4/issues/284)) [\#249](https://github.com/processing/processing4/issues/249)

* Allow imports with `color` in the name. This gets everyone's favorite toxiclibs working again. Got a fix from Sam, fingers crossed that it doesn't introduce new quirks. [\#240](https://github.com/processing/processing4/issues/240), [\#246](https://github.com/processing/processing4/pull/246)

* Movie Maker no longer broken when there are spaces in the path to Processing. [\#268](https://github.com/processing/processing4/issues/268)

* Debugger was not working when selecting Debug from the menu, now fixed. [\#282](https://github.com/processing/processing4/issues/282)

* "Massachusetts Institue of Technology" typo in loading screen. Not actually a big fix, but lots of reports about this one. [\#254](https://github.com/processing/processing4/issues/254)


## …but it's still a beta

Not everything is fixed yet. Here are a few of the more obvious:

* The colors, theme, buttons, interface, icons, etc are not yet complete. We have the necessary help, we just need more time. [\#48](https://github.com/processing/processing4/issues/48)

* Windows: Editor cursor position is offset to the right when display scaling >100% [\#226](https://github.com/processing/processing4/issues/226)

* macOS: IDE cursor position is wrong if font size is changed in Preferences. This may be specific to multiple displays, when one is retina and the other is not. [\#194](https://github.com/processing/processing4/issues/194)

* Export to Application not working with the current video library. The video library isn't handled by me, but we keep hearing about it. Updates will be posted [here](https://github.com/processing/processing-video/issues/188).


## Contributed Fixes

I love getting help from the community. Thank you!

* The welcome screen was persistent, even if you told it to go away. Oops. [\#48](https://github.com/processing/processing4/issues/48), [\#253](https://github.com/processing/processing4/issues/253)

* Fix minor typos in the PWM code for the IO library. [\#266](https://github.com/processing/processing4/pull/266)

* French translation: fixed typos and added missing items. [\#258](https://github.com/processing/processing4/pull/258)

* Fixed for JSSC library layout and upstream updates. [\#119](https://github.com/processing/processing4/issues/119), [\#229](https://github.com/processing/processing4/pull/229)


## Other Changes

Things you may not actally notice.

* Added `-Dpython.console.encoding=UTF-8` for Python Mode at the [request of jdf](https://github.com/jdf/Processing.py-Bugs/issues/322).

* Removed translated URLs that are not actually translated. Some of the Help menu translations were pointed at ancient links. [\#250](https://github.com/processing/processing4/issues/250)

* Switch to getModifiersEx() in `processing.app` code. [\#67](https://github.com/processing/processing4/issues/67)

* Deal with getFontMetrics() deprecation warning in EditorToolbar.


# Processing 4.0 beta 1

*Revision 1276 – 9 August 2021*

Celebrating the 20th anniversary of the very first Processing release (revision 0001) which was first posted to be shared as part of a workshop in Japan at Musashino Art University (https://dbn.media.mit.edu/workshops/musabi/). This is the 277th release.

The primary goal for Processing 4 is to keep everyone's code running, even as operating systems, hardware, and hairlines continue to change.

This beta release will become the default download on the site, which means that it is more stable, usable, and better than the 3.5.4 release from January 2020. It's hard to remember what things were like in January 2020. But if you must use pre-pandemic software, we'll be keeping the release online.


## Highlights for Processing 4

Here are some highlights for Processing 4, since this will be the first time a lot of people are taking 4.0 for a spin:

* There's a new Movie Maker that creates MP4s and Animated GIFs!

* You can bundle sketches as double-clickable `.pdez` files and Libraries/Modes/Tools as `.pdex` files for easy sharing and installation.

* We're using Java 11, which should be faster, more up to date, and a lot more compatible with newer machines.

* There have been many updates for the Video and Sound libraries as we chase Apple's ever-changing guidelines for what constitutes “safe” software.

* For users more experienced with Java, you can now use newer language features! Sam Pottinger rewired the preprocessor (and brought us Java 11 support as well).


## Changes since alpha 6

A lot has changed! Trying to get everything in under the wire as we work to finalize 4.0.


### Features and Updates

* We've started work on refreshing the design. This round has a new set of colors, icons, a splash screen, and more. If you like them, great! If not, please hold your complaints. The internet doesn't need more negativity! We still have a lot of work to do, and we think you'll be happy with the final result.

* It's now possible to bundle sketches into a single file to be loaded inside the PDE. This is done with `.pdez` files, which is a sketch folder saved as a `.zip` but with the extension changed to `.pdez`. This means you can post a sketch on the web as a `.pdez`, and someone with Processing can click the link and have it load directly in the PDE. [\#73](https://github.com/processing/processing/issues/73), [\#3987](https://github.com/processing/processing/issues/3987)

* Similar to `.pdez` files, you can install Libraries, Modes, Tools, and Example sets (things that would normally be installed with the Contribution Manager) by renaming their `.zip` file to `.pdez`. Double-clicking a `.pdez` file will open it with Processing, and ask the user whether they'd like to install it.

* It's now possible to do code completion and refactoring even when `.java` tabs are included in a sketch. Thanks Sam! [\#157](https://github.com/processing/processing4/issues/157), [\#230](https://github.com/processing/processing4/pull/230)

* Moved the preferences to `~/.config/processing` on Linux instead of `~/.processing`. This means your settings will be reset, but for most, that will be more of a plus with 4.x. [\#203]( https://github.com/processing/processing4/issues/203)

* Initial update of the splash screen and icons. These still need some work: the icons are too muddy at smaller sizes, for instance.

* The Welcome screen has been reset, so folks will see it again. We haven't made a decision on the Welcome screen for the final 4.0, but plan for it to be more useful than what's there now.

* “Show Sketch Folder”, “Add File”, and “Export to Application” now require Untitled or Read-Only sketches to be saved first, which avoids a weird situation where the user is dealing with files in hidden temporary folders. [\#2459](https://github.com/processing/processing/issues/2459)

* The reference for Java Mode is now served up from a web server that lives inside the PDE. This means that the download has just a single file for the reference, instead of thousands of tiny `.html` files. Far fewer things to copy makes the installation process much smoother.


### Bug Fixes

* Really chatty console messages for longtime users who had older (like 2.x) settings files still on their machine.

* IDE cursor position on Windows was going weird if display scaling used. [\#226](https://github.com/processing/processing4/issues/226)

* Only call `errorTable.updateTheme()` if the Mode is using an Error Table (Python was not).

* `PShape.scale()` not working with `PShape.resetMatrix()` when P2D renderer is used. [\#217](https://github.com/processing/processing4/issues/217), [\#225](https://github.com/processing/processing4/pull/225)


### Should Be Fixed

Several things that should no longer be a problem based on updates we've done in 4.x, but not necessarily verified 100%.

* Undo feature may have undesired results (Fixed in 4.0a4) [\#4775](https://github.com/processing/processing/issues/4775)

* HiDPI support for GNOME desktop. [\#6059](https://github.com/processing/processing/issues/6059)

* AppKit errors from P2D/P3D. [\#5880](https://github.com/processing/processing/issues/5880)

* Export Application broken in Processing 3.5.4 when using P2D or P3D renderers. [\#5983](https://github.com/processing/processing/issues/5983)

* Cannot run `rotateZ()` within the `PShape` class. [\#5770](https://github.com/processing/processing/issues/5770)

* `Profile GL4bc is not available on X11GraphicsDevice` error fixed with new JOGL release. [\#6160](https://github.com/processing/processing/issues/6160), [\#6154](https://github.com/processing/processing/issues/6154).

* `Profile GL3bc is not available on X11GraphicsDevice` should also be fixed. [\#5476](https://github.com/processing/processing/issues/5476)


### Internal Changes

Things you're unlikely to notice, but in case something seems off, it's better to make note of them in case you see a related problem pop up.

* Now using JDK 11.0.12+7.

* Cleaning up `suggestions.txt` handling and related code.

* Removed code for pulling fonts from `JAVA_HOME/lib/fonts`, because it no longer exists in Java 11.

* Update `EditorFooter.updateMode()` to `EditorFooter.updateTheme()` and add it to the code called by `Editor.updateTheme()`

* Removed the JRE Downloader, because it's no longer necessary. [\#155](https://github.com/processing/processing4/issues/155)

* Changed `Messages.loge()` to `Messages.err()`.


### Known Issues

* Support for `.pdez` and `.pdex` is not yet complete on Linux. Please help! [\#239](https://github.com/processing/processing4/issues/239)

* Have I mentioned that the design of the icons, theme, layout, etc aren't finished?



# Processing 4.0 alpha 6

*Revision 1275 – 10 July 2021*

Code completion is back!

Added a new Movie Maker that creates MP4s and Animated GIFs!

And a new color scheme sure to bring out the cranks!


### New Features

* Movie Maker has been rewritten and much improved! It can now directly create high quality MPEG-4 videos and Animated GIFs. Due to Apple [removing support for most video codecs](https://support.apple.com/en-us/HT202884) after macOS Mojave, we could no longer export QuickTime videos. The new Tool uses [FFmpeg](https://ffmpeg.org/) behind the scenes. The Tool also supports [Apple ProRes 4444](https://support.apple.com/en-us/HT202410), which is very high quality, and incidentally, the format that Apple's “QTMovieModernizer” formerly used to re-encode “legacy” video formats. [\#6110](https://github.com/processing/processing/issues/6110)


### Design and Themes

* We've started work on refreshing the design. This round has a new set of colors. If you like them, great! If not, please hold your complaints. The internet doesn't need more negativity! We know some people won't like it, and we're [still working on it](https://twitter.com/ben_fry/status/1409968426093735941). We think you'll be happy with the final version—we have some exciting updates that we aren't yet ready to share, and it will all make more sense as the system comes together. [\#48](https://github.com/processing/processing4/issues/48)

* In the meantime, if you'd like to customize the colors, instructions are [here](https://github.com/processing/processing4/wiki/Themes).

* The "4" icon and the current "About" screen are only placeholders. I was tired of looking at the 3.x design, and also needed to be able to tell the versions apart from one another. It's also necessary to start the replacement process: figuring out what things need to be updated when we incorporate the real versions.

* All that said, major work underway for improvements to how the visual theme is handled. We hope to ship with a dark mode option as well. Stay tuned!

* The splash screen handler has been rewritten because the Windows version in launch4j was too brittle. The downside is that it's a fraction of a second slower to show up, but the upside is that hi-res Linux and Windows displays get a nice 2x version instead of the crunchy low-fi (not in a good way) version.

* Add `ui.font.family` and `ui.font.size` as preferences.

* Added support for `0x` numbers to support alpha colors in `theme.txt`.


### Bug Fixes

* Code completion is fixed. Thanks [Sam](https://github.com/sampottinger)! [\#177](https://github.com/processing/processing4/issues/177), [\#219](https://github.com/processing/processing4/pull/219)

* `mouseButton` was not set correctly on `mouseReleased()` with Java2D. [\#181](https://github.com/processing/processing4/issues/181)

* A more useful message for the `NoClassDefError: processing/core/PApplet` startup error on Windows was in the alpha 5 source, but may not have made it into the actual release. [\#154](https://github.com/processing/processing4/issues/154)

* Fix `Module javafx.base not found` on Linux. Thanks [letorbi](https://github.com/letorbi). [\#214](https://github.com/processing/processing4/issues/214), [\#215](https://github.com/processing/processing4/pull/215)

* After selecting a font other than Source Code Pro, font went to a default. [\#216](https://github.com/processing/processing4/pull/216)

* `unregisterMethod()` was broken. [\#223](https://github.com/processing/processing4/issues/223)

* Fixed "No library found for org.w3c.dom" message when using that (built-in) package.


### Changes

* When changing to an incompatible Mode, just open a new window instead of giving the user a potentially confusing error message about it. [\#189](https://github.com/processing/processing4/issues/189)


### API Changes

None of these should break anything, but if they do, please let us know!

* `Editor.applyPreferences()` was `protected`, now it's `public`.

* Removed `Editor.repaintErrorBar()` and `Editor.showConsole()` because they didn't appear to be in use. Holler if this breaks anything.

* Renamed `TextAreaPainter.getCompositionTextpainter()` to `getCompositionTextPainter()`.


### Internal Changes

* Removed `java.class.path` when launching code from inside the PDE. This should prevent conflicts, and avoid introducing problems when using Export to Application.

* Removed compound key actions (which were undocumented and not in use). This clears up a lot of complexity in `DefaultInputHandler`.

* Remove `jdt.compiler.jar` from subprojects.

* Cleaned up lots of dead/unused parts of `javafx/build.xml`.

* Move `ISSUE_TEMPLATE` to the `.github` subfolder.

* Removed extra files from Tools folders for the download.

* Moved doclet to separate repo. Thanks DSI! [\#218](https://github.com/processing/processing4/issues/218), [\#222](https://github.com/processing/processing4/pull/222)



# Processing 4.0 alpha 5

*Revision 1274 – 24 June 2021*

Sneaking a release out the door the morning before our company meeting. Don't tell my boss, he's kind of a jerk.


### Known Bugs

* Code completion is currently broken. Any updates will be posted [here](https://github.com/processing/processing4/issues/177).

* Plenty of other issues being tracked in the [Processing 4](https://github.com/processing/processing4/issues) and [Processing 3](https://github.com/processing/processing/issues) repositories. Please help!


### Updates and Additions

* Added a [few more](https://github.com/processing/processing4/commit/7b75acf2799f61c9c22233f38ee73c07635cea14) “entitlements” to the macOS release that may help with using the Video and Sound libraries, especially on Big Sur.

* Moved from the 11.0.2 LTS version of JavaFX to the in-progress version 16. This fixes a [garbled text](https://bugs.openjdk.java.net/browse/JDK-8234916) issue that was breaking Tools that used JavaFX.

* JavaFX has been moved out of core and into a separate library. After Java 8, it's no longer part of the JDK, so it requires additional files that were formerly included by default. The Processing version of that library comes in at 180 MB, which seems excessive to include with every project, regardless of whether it's used. (And that's not including the full Webkit implementation, which adds \~80 MB per platform.)

* JavaFX is back and working again! This also fixes some Tools that relied on it, and Export to Application should be working as well. [\#110](https://github.com/processing/processing4/issues/110), [\#112](https://github.com/processing/processing4/pull/112), [\#3288](https://github.com/processing/processing/issues/3288), [\#209](https://github.com/processing/processing4/issues/209), [\#210](https://github.com/processing/processing4/issues/210)


### Other Fixes and Changes

* Major font cleanup inside Preferences. It appears that the “Monospace” font may be [missing or broken](https://www.oracle.com/java/technologies/javase/11-relnote-issues.html#JDK-8191522) with OpenJDK 11. Does it show a random sans serif for you? Let us know if it does. But aside from that, the Editor and Console font should be behaving a little more reliably.

* The Windows splash screen should no longer be tiny. Still sorting out some hidpi issues on Windows, but this one might make things a bit less quirky. [\#4896](https://github.com/processing/processing/issues/4896), [\#145](https://github.com/processing/processing4/issues/145)

* Better handling of `NoClassDefError: processing/core/PApplet` on startup with Windows 10. [\#154](https://github.com/processing/processing4/issues/154)

* No longer using `JFileChooser` on macOS; it's too awful. This means a Copy/Paste issue comes back, but the cure was worse than the disease. [\#1035](https://github.com/processing/processing/issues/1035), [\#77](https://github.com/processing/processing4/issues/77)


### Internal Changes

* The minimum system version for macOS (for the PDE and exported applications) is now set to 10.14.6 (the last update of Mojave). 10.13 (High Sierra) is no longer supported by Apple as of September or December 2020 (depending on what you read), and for our sanity, we're dropping it as well.

* Updated JNA from 5.7.0 to 5.8.0.

* Removed the `ant` binary from the repo, and updated the version we're using from 1.8.2 to 1.10.10.

* Rebuilt the `appbundler` tool for macOS to handle some recent changes, and disabled some logging chatter as well.

* Update to launch4j 3.14, fixing Export to Application on Windows.


# Processing 4.0 alpha 4

*Revision 1273 - 15 June 2021*

Happy birthday to my goddaughter Kelsey! Let's celebrate with another alpha release.

This should be a bit more stable than the last round. I've rolled back some of the more aggressive anti-AWT changes (bad for longevity, good for compatibility) so images in particular are now behaving better.

But enough of that, let's go to the phone lines:


### What bugs have been fixed; why should I care?

* Sketch window location is saved once again: re-running a sketch will open the window in the same location. This was broken for a while! [\#158](https://github.com/processing/processing4/issues/158), [\#5843](https://github.com/processing/processing/issues/5843), [\#5781](https://github.com/processing/processing/issues/5781)

* When using multiple monitors, new Editor windows will open on the same display as the most recently opened Editor window. [\#205](https://github.com/processing/processing4/issues/205), formerly [\#1566](https://github.com/processing/processing/issues/1566)

* A major Undo fix, this may even be [the big one](https://github.com/processing/processing/issues/4775), but it's not confirmed. (Please help confirm!) [\#175](https://github.com/processing/processing4/pull/175)


### Were you too hasty with exorcising AWT?

* `cursor(PImage)` broken everywhere because `PImage.getNative()` returns `null` [\#180](https://github.com/processing/processing4/issues/180)

* `PImage.resize()` not working properly. [\#200](https://github.com/processing/processing4/issues/200)

* `copy()` not working correctly. [\#169](https://github.com/processing/processing4/issues/169)


### Did you find any particularly niggling, but small issues?

* Catch `NoClassDefError` in `Platform.deleteFile()` (still unclear of its cause) on Big Sur. [\#159](https://github.com/processing/processing4/issues/159), [\#6185](https://github.com/processing/processing/issues/6185)

* Fixed `Exception in thread "Contribution Uninstaller" NullPointerException` when removing an installed contribution. [\#174](https://github.com/processing/processing4/issues/174)

* If the default display is selected in the Preferences window, store that, rather than its number. It was discovered that plugging in a second display could bump the “default” display to number 2, even while it was still selected. Yay!

* Sort out calling `unregisterMethod()` for `dispose` from `dispose()` makes for bad state situation. [\#199](https://github.com/processing/processing4/pull/199)


### How about contributions from the community?

+ Don't sort user's charset array when calling `createFont()`. [\#197](https://github.com/processing/processing4/issues/197), [\#198](https://github.com/processing/processing4/pull/198)

* Some exciting things are on the way for the documentation and web site. [\#191](https://github.com/processing/processing4/pull/191)

* Update Batik to 1.14. [\#179](https://github.com/processing/processing4/issues/179), [\#192](https://github.com/processing/processing4/issues/192), [\#183](https://github.com/processing/processing4/pull/183)

* Tweak the circle for number of updates based on Akarshit's initial attempt. [\#201](https://github.com/processing/processing4/issues/201), [\#4097](https://github.com/processing/processing/pull/4097)

* Make `parseJSONObject()` and `parseJSONArray()` return `null` when parsing fails. [\#165](https://github.com/processing/processing4/issues/165), [\#166](https://github.com/processing/processing4/pull/166)


### Is there anything new?

+ Added `PVector.setHeading()` for parity with p5.js. [\#193](https://github.com/processing/processing4/issues/193)

* The default font (what you get if `textFont()` isnot used) has been changed to Source Sans instead of Lucida Sans. I just couldn't take Lucida any longer.


### Were there any internal changes I probably won't notice?

* Updated to JDK 11.0.11+9

* Update from JNA 5.2.0 to 5.7.0

* Modernize the RegisteredMethods code to use collections classes w/ concurrency. [\#199](https://github.com/processing/processing4/pull/199)

* Set closed issues to [automatically lock](https://github.com/dessant/lock-threads) after they've been closed for 30 days. (This has no effect on open issues, only closed ones.) Actually this one you may have noticed if you had a lot of notifications turned on.

* Slowly transitioning some of the older code to newer syntax (lambda functions, etc). This is not a priority for anyone else: it's being done slowly, and as a chance to do code review on some very old work.


* Fix `textMode(SHAPE) is not supported by this renderer` message with SVG Export. [\#202](https://github.com/processing/processing4/issues/202), [\#6169](https://github.com/processing/processing/issues/6169)


# Processing 4.0 alpha 3

*Revision 1272 - 17 January 2021*

Happy [Martin Luther King Day](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Martin_Luther_King_Jr._Day)! (Or MLK Day Eve, if you're reading this on Sunday.)

Several bug fixes and updates in this release, the most significant being video capture on macOS should be working again, and several OpenGL fixes that come with an updated release of JOGL. (Thanks to Sven Göthel, who continues working on it after many years.)

### Known Issues

* The ugly `surface.setResizable()` workaround in the previous release is now properly fixed. [124](https://github.com/processing/processing4/issues/124)
* Haven't had a chance to test much with macOS running on M1 machines. Chances are this should run in Rosetta mode, but I've not had time to find out.

### Fixes and Updates

* Video [was broken](https://github.com/processing/processing-video/issues/134) on macOS because of Apple's security changes.
* Audio was [also broken](https://github.com/processing/processing-sound/issues/51) on macOS because of Apple security changes.
* Fix `NullPointerException` in `getSystemZoom()` on startup in alpha 2. [143](https://github.com/processing/processing4/issues/143)
* `loadJSONObject()` and `loadJSONArray()` now return `null` if the given file was not found (in line with other `loadXxxx()` APIs. [6081](https://github.com/processing/processing/pull/6081)
* Update the splash screen to say 2021 before the pedants can hunt me down.
* Contribution translation updates (thank you!)
    * Updates and fixes for the Portugese translation [133](https://github.com/processing/processing4/pull/133), [134](https://github.com/processing/processing4/pull/134), [147](https://github.com/processing/processing4/pull/147)
    * Correct alphabetical order for the language list. [146](https://github.com/processing/processing4/pull/146)
* Remove zero width no-break space `U+FEFF` character with `trim()`.
* `PShapeOpenGL.setAttrib()` warning referenced `setNormal()` instead of `setAttrib()`. [141](https://github.com/processing/processing4/issues/141)
* Add `var` keyword to highlighting [114](https://github.com/processing/processing4/issues/114)
* Fix revision number in exported code [135](https://github.com/processing/processing4/issues/135)

### And More from Sam

* Fix preprocessor spaces in the `size()` command to follow our guidelines. [136](https://github.com/processing/processing4/issues/136), [138](https://github.com/processing/processing4/pull/138)
* Move `PdePreprocessIssueException` to the test package. [130](https://github.com/processing/processing4/issues/130), [139](https://github.com/processing/processing4/pull/139)
* Fix regression where  `smooth(4)` was showing the “smooth() can only be used inside settings()” error. [149](https://github.com/processing/processing4/issues/149), [152](https://github.com/processing/processing4/pull/152)

### Internal Additions

* You can now create a “source” `.jar` file by typing `ant source-jar` inside the `core` directory. [118](https://github.com/processing/processing4/issues/118)
* Update Batik from 1.8 to 1.13 inside SVG Export library. Fixes incompatibilities with Java 11.
* Automate macOS notarization in the build process (done in 4.0a2) [24](https://github.com/processing/processing4/issues/24)
* Show Tool incompatibilities with a message dialog, and clean up a little of the internal error handling.
* Prevent “illegal line” message when loading library with `0xFEFF` chars in a `.properties` file
* Fixes to `Platform` code
    * Get rid of `editor.laf.vaqua` preference (use the `editor.laf` preference instead)
    * Move macOS-specific code out of `DefaultPlatform` and into `MacPlatform`
* Clean up “Export to Application”
    * Turned off 32-bit and ARM exports (no longer supported)
    * Drop '64' from the folder name (everything 64-bit from now on)
    * Remove “big fat lie“ error spew on export
    * Too many `.dll` and `.jar` files were included
    * Updates and text changes to be a little clearer
    * Fixed links for Java 11
    * Set minimum version on Windows, fix JDK download URL


# Processing 4.0 alpha 2

*Revision 1271 - 15 September 2020*

Several fixes for this round, plus working on the guts quite a bit to prepare for newer/faster/better rendering methods.

The minimum system version for macOS (for the PDE and exported applications) is now set to 10.13.6 (the last update of High Sierra). Apple will likely be dropping support for High Sierra in late 2020, so we may make Mojave (10.14) the minimum by the time Processing 4.x ships.


### Known Issues

* If you're using P2D or P3D on macOS, and have `surface.setResizable(true)` inside `setup()`, you'll need to (temporarily) move that into `draw()`. We had to do an ugly hack at release time due to issue [124](https://github.com/processing/processing4/issues/124). The ugly hack also involves the window flickering once when it first opens in this situation. We should have that fixed for the next release.


### Bug Fixes

* Break `buildMenu()` into `populateMenu()` method to delay Debugger init [73](https://github.com/processing/processing4/issues/73)
* Fix broken macOS build [83](https://github.com/processing/processing4/issues/83)
* Bump JDK to 11.0.8, then rolled back to JDK 11.0.6 again [121](https://github.com/processing/processing4/issues/121), [123](https://github.com/processing/processing4/pull/123)
* Make macOS notarization part of the build process [24](https://github.com/processing/processing4/issues/24)
* `NullPointerException` in `ContributionManager.updateFlagged()` on startup. Now checks for directory `modes` and `tools` directories and read/write access on startup [6034](https://github.com/processing/processing/issues/6034)
* PDF was broken on `getImage()` call [62](https://github.com/processing/processing4/issues/62), [commit](https://github.com/processing/processing4/commit/624e9074aeb1d9e2e6b2943e35ffd97a90b8b737)


### Changes for AWT

To make way for more advanced rendering options, the exorcism of AWT from the base classes inside core has begun. More about that here: <https://github.com/processing/processing4/wiki/Exorcising-AWT>

* Remove all usage of AWT from `PApplet` [55](https://github.com/processing/processing4/issues/55)
* Make edits to core so that AWT can be disabled and LWJGL can run [commit](https://github.com/codeanticode/processing-openjdk/commit/ac9abc18655daaa538ef16945687177334f3596e)
* Add `--disable-awt` option to `PApplet.main()`
* Fix for precision issues with PDF [5801](https://github.com/processing/processing/issues/5801#issuecomment-466632459)
* Implement `displayDensity(int)`, it's been returning the main display's value
* Show “displays have separate spaces” warning message when the param is unset
    * Show it in the console, which allows us to get rid of `JOptionPane`
    * Catalina seems to have it un-set, but the default is the same
* Move `selectInput/Output/Folder` to `ShimAWT` class
* remove the `java.awt.Frame` object from `PApplet`
* Move `loadImage()` into `ShimAWT`
* `desktopFile()` and `desktopPath()` methods are supported, unless we find they're trouble
* Move `ShimAWT.loadImage()` to the `PSurface` subclasses
* Move all `java.awt` and `javax.imageio` out of `PImage`
* Make the switch to `getModifiersEx()` instead of `getModifiers()` [4](https://github.com/processing/processing4/issues/4)
* Fix `PImage.save()` breakage due to AWT changes above (saving to PNG was broken in anything but the default renderer) [80](https://github.com/processing/processing4/issues/80)

* Fix `WARNING: Illegal reflective access by processing.opengl.PSurfaceJOGL” on getContextCapabilities()` [50](https://github.com/processing/processing4/issues/50), [76](https://github.com/processing/processing4/pull/76)
* Migrate JSSC to sampottinger/jssc [71](https://github.com/processing/processing4/issues/71), [75](https://github.com/processing/processing4/pull/75)
* Rewrite size call for all renderers [90](https://github.com/processing/processing4/issues/90), [91](https://github.com/processing/processing4/pull/91)
* Switch to JFileChooser on Mac with VAqua [88](https://github.com/processing/processing4/pull/88)
* Cut/Copy/Paste while saving a sketch on macOS was going to the editor, not the save dialog [77](https://github.com/processing/processing4/issues/77)

### Other Contributed Changes

* Remove some redundant boxing and casting [51](https://github.com/processing/processing4/pull/51)


# Processing 4.0 alpha 1

*Revision 1270 - 18 January 2020*

This is a massive update! With the help of [Sam Pottinger](https://gleap.org/), we're working to get Processing to run with Java 11. This will give us a more stable platform for the next few years.

In the process, there are also significant updates which include updated Java syntax support and lots of other long-awaited features.

We've started a [Changes in 4.0](https://github.com/processing/processing4/wiki/Changes-in-4.0) document to keep track of all the details.

We recommend using a different sketchbook location for 4.0, to avoid confusion with things that might be incompatible with your 3.0 work.
